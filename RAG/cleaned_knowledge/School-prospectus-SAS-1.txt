=== Section: Sas History ===

=== Section ===
The biggest institution of higher learning in Northern Philippines was a one-building college, its
campus hewn out of the hillside of the Baguio Cathedral when Saint Louis University had its
collegiate beginnings in 1952. In 1956, the master's program in Education of the then Saint Louis
College was granted government recognition. During the early school years, the Graduate
School of Arts and Sciences was administered by the following Deans: Rev. Fr. Joseph Herpels

=== Section ===
(1955-1957), Dr. Sofia Elizalde (1957-1958), Rev. Fr. Francis Gevers (1958-1959), and Rev. Fr. Alberto
van Overbeke (1959-1961). After Saint Louis University was inaugurated in 1963, the Graduate Programs expanded
gradually to include master's degrees in Management Engineering (1956), English (1957),
Business Management (1966), Economics (1972), Teaching (1972), Psychology (1981), Biology
(1981), College of Teaching and Public Management (1993), as well as doctoral programs in

Education (1969) and English (1979). In 1995, the university opened its master's programs in
Nursing and Information Technology. Starting 1996-1997, the various Graduate Programs
were integrated into the other colleges of the university to which the undergraduate
equivalents of these programs belong, thus ensuring smooth and solid disciplinal continuity.
However, in 2018, with the growing number of Graduate Programs being offered, the School

=== Section ===
of Advanced Studies (SAS) was established, housing all the university's Graduate Programs
that are geared towards advanced, interdisciplinary scholarly research and academic work.
With the Dean as its overall administrator, the school is composed of seven (7) clusters
namely, Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM), Computing and Information
Technology (CIT), Engineering (ENGG), Liberal Arts (LIBARTS), Natural Sciences (NATSCI),

=== Section ===
Nursing (NRSG), and Teacher Education (TEACHED). To ensure efficient supervision and
management of programs in each cluster, Graduate Program Coordinators (GPCs) with
aligned qualifications are designated. Such a structure has existed since 1990 when Program
Coordinators were appointed to assist in the smooth implementation of programs and
activities at the graduate level.
To date (AY 2022-2023), there are 32 programs in the School of Advanced Studies. School of Advanced Studies
