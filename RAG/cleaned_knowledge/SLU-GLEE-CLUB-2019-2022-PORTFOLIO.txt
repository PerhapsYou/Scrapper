The Center for Culture and the Arts was founded in May 1993 during the presidency
of Fr. Joseph Van den Daelen, who believed that in addition to providing quality
elementary, secondary, and tertiary education, SLU should also be a place where
cultural heritage and the arts are preserved and perpetuated. The birth of the three
resident performing groups of the center (Glee club, Dance troupe, and the
Tanghalang SLU) was only once a dream, but with its fruition, the Center has

Story  in 1996,  The Fantasticks  in 1999, and school productio ns of the greatly
popular and celebrated musicals  Les Miserables  in 2002 and 2003, and  Miss
