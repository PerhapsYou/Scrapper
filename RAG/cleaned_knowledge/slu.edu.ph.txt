The FRIENDS project title stands for Furthering International Relations Capacities and Intercultural Engagement to Nurture Campus Diversity and to Support Internationalization at Home. The project is built around the concept of Internationalization at Home (IaH) that reframes the traditional perceptions of higher education internationalization in the five partner countries involved, namely Bhutan, Cambodia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. The notion of IaH is based on the assumption that for various reasons, the largest part of the university student body will remain non-mobile and therefore deprived from access to global knowledge and skills.

The project of establishing a center for psychosocial diagnosis and treatment for children goes back to the involvement of Fr. Geraldo Costa, CICM, in the ministry for street children in Metro Manila.From 1999 to 2000, Fr. Costa stayed at the Senden Home Residential Center in Binangonan, Rizal. While providing psychosocial assistance to the children in the center, Fr. Costa observed that most of the children possess an  open wound  that hinders them from flourishing to their full potential. Fr. Costa visited several other children s institutions in Metro Manila seeking to understand what was observed in Senden Home. He noticed that that the  open wound  was a constant in most centers for children in special situations. In interviews with directors and staff of residential and temporary shelters, he noted two main unanswered problems: first, the need to help the children to overcome past traumatic experiences, and second, the need to help the children to recover their personal development, which may have been compromised by the hardships that the children encountered in their young life. In a visit to the United Nations Children s Fund in Manila (UNICEF-Manila) and to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in Metro Manila in 1999, the same concerns were expressed.In 2000, a study about the needs of the children in special situations in the Philippines, especially in Metro Manila, was presented by Fr. Costa to the RP-CICM Provincial Superior. As a response, the Provincial Superior approved a project proposal which would assist the shelters and institutions working with children in need of psychosocial assistance.From the school year 2001-2002, several steps were made towards the organization of a psychosocial therapeutic center for children. Firstly, weekly therapy sessions were given to the children of DSWD shelters in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). Secondly, senior students from the Department of Psychology of Saint Louis University (SLU) started volunteering at the Reception and Study Center for Children (RSCC) of DSWD in Puguis, La Trinidad, Benguet. Thirdly, active promotion of Children s Rights in the SLU campus and in the areas of Baguio City and Benguet was accomplished. Fourthly, a small therapeutic playroom in the Home Sweet Home Compound was opened and children who need special attention and who also come from indigent families were welcomed for psychological assessment and intervention.In the beginning of 2003, Fr. Paul Van Parijs, CICM, then SLU President, proposed to Fr. Costa to stay in SLU and establish the project of a center for psychosocial diagnosis and treatment for children in Baguio City. The center would be working together with the Department of Psychology, the Clinical Pastoral Office, and the Guidance Center of the university. Despite that the first plan was to have the center in Manila, the RP-CICM Provincial Superior approved such proposal. Consequently, the services provided at that time in the small playroom in Home Sweet Home could be extended.In March 18, 2003, the Child and Youth Wellness Center (CYWC) of Saint Louis University was officially inaugurated in the Home Sweet Home compound. A room of the old Catholic Press was transformed in three small offices and a room for therapeutic sessions.By the school year 2003-2004, two courses related to the clinical approach in handling children s cases were offered in the Graduate Program of Psychology, namely, Clinical Interventions for Children (Psych 232), and Psychotherapy for Children (Psych 233). The students enrolled therein had a hands-on application of the theories they had learned by holding actual therapeutic sessions in the Center. The courses are offered every two years, thus, increasing the number of child therapists serving children in need of psychosocial assistance.In April 15, 2011, the Sunflower on the Hill was inaugurated in Bukal ng Tipan, Maryhill, Taytay, Rizal. The staff and volunteers pool together their competencies, creativeness, and willingness to assist children and families in the areas of Rizal, Antipolo, and other nearby provinces. Meanwhile, the Sunflower Centennial Halfway Home for Boys was officially inaugurated in April 28, 2011. The Halfway Home provides program and services for boys have experienced abuse, abandonment and/or neglect.In 2015, there was a proposal for an advocacy project focusing on child protection and prevention against abuse in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). The project was spearheaded by the SLU Sunflower Child and Youth Wellness Center in partnership with the Flinders University of South Australia students, the CJ Moran Community Legal Assistance Office of the SLU School of Law, SLU Social Work Department, Municipality of Kibungan, Benguet, and the Municipality of Mankayan, Benguet. As the years passed, other international partners were involved to include the Australian Volunteers for International Development (AVID) and the US Peace Corps (USPC). Indeed, the SLU Sunflower Child and Youth Wellness Center has grown and is continuously growing. Our history will show how far the center has gone and how far it will go as it continues to make a mark as an institution dedicated to providing assistance to children of the Cordilleras and beyond.

Saint Louis University (SLU) through the Office of Institutional Development and Quality Assurance (OIDQA) officially launched the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Educational Organization Management System (EOMS) Project in alignment with ISO 21001:2018 standards.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
The two-day initiative, from 19 to 20 June 2025 at the Cardinal Cardijn Hall in the SLU Student Residence Halls, is a pivotal milestone in the university s commitment to a robust and effective Quality Management System (QMS). It features targeted training sessions designed to align their functions with EOMS core principles. Key participants include Process Owners (PO), Unit Document Controllers (UDC), and Internal Quality Auditors (IQA), all of whom play crucial roles in maintaining quality standards and institutional accountability.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Mr. Hector L. Martin, OIDQA Director, ushered in the program by presenting the updated EOMS policy manual, which was first introduced during the EOMS project kick-off in January 2025. The manual was formally endorsed through a ceremonial signing led by the SLU Administration through the Vice President for Administration, Atty. Shellah Yzanne P. Merced.
=== End ===

The signing was witnessed by School of Teacher Education and Liberal Arts (STELA) Dean Mary Pauline E. Namoca, PhD, RPsy; School of Advanced Studies (SAS) Dean Faridah Kristi Wetherick, PhD; School of Engineering and Architecture (SEA) Dean Engr. Jeffrey Des Binwag; and School of Medicine (SOM) Dean Dr. John Anthony Domantay, PhD.

Mr. Teodoro V. Ramirez, Jr., Principal Consultant of AGF Consulting Group and resource person, discussed the key elements of ISO 21001:2018 Educational Organization Management System (EOMS), focusing on Documented Information as outlined in Clause 7.5. He further elaborated on several essential topics critical to implementing and maintaining an effective Quality Management System. These included Annex SL, which prescribes the standardized high-level structure for all ISO Management System Standards (MSS); the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle, a four-step method used to drive continuous improvement; Document Control Procedures to ensure consistency and accuracy of information; the Process Approach, which emphasizes managing interrelated activities as systems; and Knowledge Transfer, which supports organizational learning and sustainability.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Ramirez emphasized that  documentation is the trademark of your business process  and a fundamental part of best practices. Proper documentation ensures that standards are clearly defined and can be consistently applied across the organization. He also highlighted the importance of the Process Approach, describing it as a series of reproducible, interrelated activities that transform inputs such as people, resources, or materials into outputs that meet customer expectations.  The essence of quality is how operations are managed,  he said, underscoring that understanding and optimizing each process is key to ensuring consistent, high-quality outcomes across the institution.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
The series of EOMS training will continue on 20 June 2025, focusing specifically on the capacity-building needs of Process Owners (POs) and Internal Quality Auditors (IQAs).

International Diplomats Conference 2025: A Louisian Voice Reimagines Leadership and Peace in a Divided World

From 17-20 June 2025, the United Nations Conference Centre in Bangkok, Thailand became the meeting ground for 223 individual delegates from over 30 countries during the International Diplomats Conference.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Among the voices of change was Ms. Janica Vida Gregorio, a Saint Louis University (SLU) student of Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and an active member of the New Louisian Philosophical Society.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Gregorio was honored with the prestigious Global Peace Ambassador Award. She was also selected as one of the delegates, representing youth and grassroots activism. In this role, she collaborated with peacebuilders, human rights lawyers, educators, scientists, and CEOs dedicated to fostering inclusive peace and justice.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
To be selected as one of the partially-funded delegates amongst outstanding candidates across the world was both fulfilling and a ton of pressure of responsibility,  Gregorio expressed, reflecting on the honor of being chosen.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
The conference opened on 17 June with a Cultural Exchange Dinner a vibrant celebration of global cultures through performances, traditional attire, and cuisine. This welcome event not only highlighted cultural diversity, but also fostered informal networking and meaningful intercultural dialogue among delegates, unified by a shared vision of peace and cooperation.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
A major highlight of the event was the keynote speech by Dr. Aneel Salman, Chair of Economic Security at the Islamabad Policy Research Institute. In his address,  Leadership, Diplomacy and Development in a Divided World,  he called for a radical shift in how we define development, urging that the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) be seen not as a checklist, but as a moral obligation to build a more just and compassionate world.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Dr. Salman challenged the conventional development model and the technocratic illusion that poverty can be solved purely through data and planning. Instead, he championed a people-centered approach rooted in dignity, participation, and local wisdom.  Leadership is not about how many people are with you. It is about the people who have faith in you,  he said. He emphasized the need to empower local entrepreneurs through trust-based systems and introduced the transition from SDGs to Inner Development Goals (IDGs), advocating for emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and resilience as key to sustainable peace.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Throughout the conference, peace was redefined not as the absence of war but as a  symphony of voices learning from each other.  Activism was celebrated not only in community organizing but also in shaping diplomatic conversations and global discourse.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
During Dr. Salman s session, Ms. Gregorio offered a compelling response to his idea that  leadership is a state of mind.  She reflected that leadership is often romanticized, yet vulnerable to toxic traits such as narcissism, machiavellianism, and psychopathy. She advocated for a reimagined model of leadership grounded in trust, courage, compassion, and a conscious break from harmful systems. According to her,  True leadership holds more than a platform for mere development. It requires disrupting the ideological status quo. A just and firm stand for revolutionary rupture not just macro-management.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
The event concluded with a guided tour of Bangkok s historical and political landmarks on 19 June 2025. Delegates continued to engage in meaningful conversations, forging lasting connections that transcended borders and ideologies.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Organized by the Voice for Rights International Association, the International Diplomats Conference 2025 was more than a space for dialogue, it was a living ground for transformation. It united changemakers from all sectors in rethinking the future of diplomacy, leadership, and sustainable development in a fractured world.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
The conference echoed a commitment to global development through inner and formal education, trust-based leadership, and inclusive collaboration. These values closely aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 1: No Poverty, SDG 4: Quality Education, SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions, and SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals.

=== End ===

=== Section ===
On 18 June 2025, the Saint Louis University (SLU) Talged Center conducted Matchstick Sessions 3 titled,  Creative Journaling: Fearless Self-Expression and Reflection.  The morning and afternoon sessions each gathered up to 12 Louisian students, all interested to learn creative ways to express themselves through journaling.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Opening the session with a welcome message was Justine S. Latawan, Talged Center Assistant.  Smile at the person next to you,  she began.  This is a brave space where you may have something new to explore or something you may have lost but found again. Another thing, be present,  she reminded.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Ms. Latawan introduced the Luminary of the Day, Rae Floresca-Rigonan, a Louisian alumna and former instructor at the BA Communication program. She has now fully embraced the craft as an artist, journaling workshop host, and co-founder of Notable Maria.
The symbolic Matchstick Ceremony then took place to officially begin the creative session. A candle was lit expressing the thought,  As you light this match, we lend our spark and light the way for others.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Speaking to the participants, Rigonan expressed hope that after the creative journaling workshop, participants will  no longer be scared of a blank page  and that they ll have more ideas what to write on the page.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
The workshop began with a short talk about the creative process of journaling. Being both introspective and retrospective, journaling is a process of documenting thoughts, emotions, reflections, and personal experiences in written and visual form. As a tool for mental health, it aids understanding and processing feelings, reducing feelings of being overwhelmed and anxious. It emphasizes self-care and cultivates a positive self-image.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
To start journaling, one needs writing materials, ephemera, space, motivation, consistency, and curiosity. Ephemera are items designed to be useful or important for only a short period of time, often within the duration of a specific event or purpose. Think flyers, tickets, brochures, pieces of paper, anything at all that can  preserve the moment.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Several creative ways to fill journal pages include bullet journaling, collage journaling, art journaling, media journaling, reflective journaling, and creative journaling. Today, journaling extended to different niches: junk journals, travel journals, fitness journals, food journals, prayer journaling, morning pages, and more.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Each with their own journaling kit complete with a guide, sticker sheets, a handful of trinkets, and thoughtful prompts the participants set about crafting their pages with care. Whether inspired by a word, a thought, or a state of mind, each journaled and zoned in, embracing creativity and self-reflection.
After an hour, a  journal latag  took place where participants put their journals side-by-side for display, fostering the shared community experience.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Your journal is your safe space. There is no perfect journal. You don t have to be the best writer or artist in journaling. It s your personal keepsake. You may or may not show it to the world but it is also good to inspire others how journaling has helped you in your daily life. Note that it is important that you begin, enjoy the process, and learn as you progress,  Rigonan encouraged.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Matchstick Sessions are rooted in the advocacy of sharing one s passions within the community, offering individuals a space to explore themselves alongside others. This advocacy aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being, by promoting mental wellness, connection, and personal growth.

The Center provides spiritual enrichment and formation of the Louisian community such as recollections, formation sessions.It is the liturgical and sacramental expression of our vocation that is uniquely missionary.

When Saint Louis became a University in 1963, it took some years before there was an official chaplaincy. The first chaplain was then Fr. John De Cloedt who was succeeded for a while by Fr. Evarist Verlinden. In 1969, Msgr. William Brasseur allowed baptisms and marriages to be administered in the SLU Chapel. Thus, according to the books, the first baptism (an adult baptism) was administered on March 2, 1969 and the first marriage was celebrated on October 20, 1969.On May 15, 1971, Fr. John Ameye received his official appointment as chaplain of SLU. It was Fr. John who worked hard to prepare all the papers for the official erection of the SLU Parish which would be the first University in the country to become a personal parish. August 12, 1972 was the red letter day for the SLU Parish. On that day, Msgr. William Brasseur officially erected the parish and appointed Fr. John as the first Parish Priest.Fr. John held office at the Jose Burgos Building and published a weekly liturgical bulletin. Unfortunately, during the Aguinaldo masses of 1973, Fr. John got a heart attack and had to be brought to a hospital in Makati. This ended Fr. John s parish work in SLU.Fr. James Desmet, who was then the head of the Religion Department became the ad interim parish priest until Fr. Wilfried Daels arrived in September 1974. Fr. Wilfried continued the work of Fr. John and established the SLU Parish Council. Fr. Daels did not stay long because in June 1975 he went for a home vacation and got a new assignment upon his return from Belguim. Agaim, Fr. James kept the parish open until the CICM Provincial created a Pastoral Team for the SLU pArish on March 18, 1976. Fr. Luc Colla and Fr. John Slegers were the team members, and Fr. James Desmet was the team coordinator as per appointment by the Bishop.Fr. John Slegers, who was the former Secretary General of the University, worked together with Fr. James on the College level while Fr. Luc Colla, who was appointed in SLU in January 22, 1976 took care of all the pastoral work in the Elementary and High School Departments. Upon the opening of the SLU hospital on May 10, 1977, Fr. James and Fr. Luc became the Hospital Chaplains.On June 20, 1979, Fr. John Slegers was called to help out in St. Louis College in Tuguegarao. Fr. August Bellens took his place. Fr. Bellens, as member of the pastoral team, helped out in the parish, taught Scripture and cared for the chaplaincy in the SLU Sacred Heart Hospital. Unfortunately, on account of his poor health, Fr. Bellens left for Home Sweet Home on May 4, 1986. A few days later, on May 8, 1986, Fr. Andres Nowe arrived as the new team member. He continued the work of Fr. Bellens in the hospital; helped out in the parish and started teaching. On September 1, 1986, Fr. Gerard Helsen became a full time chaplain in the SLU Hospital. On October 20, 1986, Fr. Andres Nowe took over as a parish priest from Fr. James Desmet who left for his new assignment as chaplain in St. Louis College, San Fernando, La Union. October of the same year, Fr. Andres became the Parish Priest until April 1995 and the head of the Religion Department.In 1995, the Religion Department became the Institute of Philosophy and Religion (IPR) with Fr. Paul Van Parijs, CICM as head. On the same year, the IPR separates from the Parish. Fr. Crisanto Draculan, a diocesan priest from Pangasinan functioned as the Parish Priest and the Spirit of Love Catholic Community Spiritual Director. An ad-hoc parish council was implemented with 2 faculty appointees per college and 2 youth representatives. Fr. Gerard de Boeck, CICM also became the Hospital Chaplain.

The Community Extension and Outreach Programs (CEOPO) serves as the supporting and coordinating arm for the development of the University s extension and outreach programs. Its main task is to ensure that the University s extension, outreach, and social services development agenda is carried out and well-organized. Specifically, it promotes collaboration among the different schools, offices and extension institutes and foundations in the University and provides support services so as to facilitate their extension endeavors.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
SLU derives its mandate for extension and social services from its identity and role as an institution of higher learning with its trifocal functions of instruction, research, and extension. However, unlike state universities and colleges (SUCs) which are mandated specifically to align their programs in support of national, regional or local development plans (cf. RA 7722 or Higher Education Act of 1994, Sec. 2, Par.2), the University adopts a more liberal thrust for each extension programs. As CICM (Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae / Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) educational institution, it pursues its programs within the broader frame of the CICM missionary focus on the transformation of the world and the coming of the reign of God (CICM Constitutions Commentary, 1999) through its Justice, Peace, Integrity of Creation, and Indigenous Peoples  Apostolate (JPIC-IPA).Guided by the vision of holistic development of peoples and community, the University commits itself to the educational, religious, cultural, socio-economic, political, health, and environmental development needs of its partner communities and the nation as a whole. However, as there are also other institutions working on each of these areas, the University endeavours to focus on particular needs that are least attended to especially those that are in line with CICM mission priorities and Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines  JEEPGY Advocacies and insofar as its capacities can reasonably allow.As a higher education institution with expertise in teaching and research, it is precisely these specializations that the University brings to bear in its extension programs. Extension, however, is not a one-way traffic. As the University shares its expertise with the partner communities, a positive feedback is generated from the partner stakeholders and the process of extension itself, leading to more insights and questions on the state of knowledge. As theory meets practice, as formal knowledge meets casual needs, new impetus for knowledge generation and refinement shall ensue. This dynamic shall then enrich instruction and research within the University.
