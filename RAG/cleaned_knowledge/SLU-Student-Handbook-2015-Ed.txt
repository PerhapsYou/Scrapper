Dear students,
Welcome to Saint Louis University (SLU)!
There is a saying:  If you keep the rules, the rules will keep you.
Rules provide us with the right directions, in order for us to
reach our goal. Like guideposts, rules help us keep on track of
our destination. That is why I ask you to understand the integral
role of structures and procedures in your daily life. To reach your
goal, you need discipline and dedication.
The SLU Student Handbook (2015 Edition) serves as a compass
=== End ===

=== Section ===
to help you find your way in and familiarize yourselves with
university life. Moreover, it aims to guide your actions by
following guidelines, in the interest of serving the common good
of the Louisian Community.
Therefore, this student handbook wisely provides the necessary
guidelines that govern and coordinate the activities of various
student organizations aimed at ensuring a holistic or balanced
student life in the university.
A balanced student life in SLU is consistent with the CICM

=== Section ===
educational mission of promoting the well-being of students,
to develop their competencies and to help them mature in their
faith. Accordingly, the unity of academic excellence and missionary
spirit should be the hallmark of every Louisian student.
One in Heart, One in Soul,

S aint Louis University is a Catholic institution of higher learning.
It was founded by the CICM Philippine Province as one effective means

The story of St. Aloysius de Gonzaga started 435 years ago, in a
town called Castiglione, delle Steviere in Italy. Around this time and

=== Section ===
place, a young prince was born to the Gonzaga family. A prince destined to be a great ruler, a man of innumerable riches and military strength. A nobleman envied by men and adored by women. For he was the son of the Marquis de Gonzaga, and his name was Aloysius.Aloysius grew to be a boy with his entire life planned for him. He was to be a great prince and ruler of men and a great soldier, a general of armies and a conqueror of enemies. This was the life Marquis Gonzaga had planned for him. Aloysius displayed great amounts of daring, courage and cool-mindedness even in the face of danger. However, there was another side to Aloysius  character. His mother was a pious woman who loved to pray and to think about God, and the passing joys of this earth meant little to her. It was she who taught the boy to love the things of the spirit as he grew.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
When he received Jesus from Charles Borromeo, the Archbishop
of Milan, in First Holy Communion, Aloysius knelt in adoration, making a vow from the depths of his heart that he would make God his first and last love and asking the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.
Jesus had suffered on

=== Section ===
the cross for the love of each man; so Aloysius wanted to suffer too, to show his love for Jesus. The prince made mortifications, trying not to take the most delicious food, avoiding wearing the most handsome clothes, and even putting bits of wood in his bed at night so as to have some pain to suffer. Any pleasure which his nature might want to enjoy, his spirit told him to ignore.
When Aloysius grew

Aloysius reluctantly obeyed his father and became a royal page
of Prince James, son of the king. Yet he still persisted with his
mortifications and did not dress richly nor did he take any of the best food. He felt that he had to imitate the poverty of Jesus in a small way at least.
The prince wanted nothing more than to serve God and suffer as

=== Section ===
Jesus had suffered, so when he went back to Italy, he made up his mind to give up his royal title of prince and enter the Jesuit Order.
His father was outraged at the thought of his son, a Gonzaga   a
royal prince, becoming a lowly priest and refused to allow Aloysius  decision. Yet with a determined will, Aloysius convinced his father that to become a Jesuit was the life for him.
So on November 25, 1585, Aloysius entered the Jesuit Order

=== Section ===
as a Novice. With high hopes of becoming a missionary and to work among poor pagans, he worked hard, settling down to a life of prayer and penance. He learned to do each one of his new duties well and everyday became more humble, more obedient, and more pure.He was ready to be ordained a priest when an epidemic broke out in Rome in 1591. Hospitals were soon overflowing and people were dying in their homes and in the streets. The Jesuit Fathers hurriedly opened a hospital of their own, and Aloysius went around the city in patched clothing begging for money to buy food for the sick patients. He, together with other seminarians, helped take care of the afflicted.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Eventually, because of direct contact
with the sick, Aloysius caught the plague.
For three months, the youth lay in a little
white bed, while the fever burned
inside him. He spent his remaining time on earth praying to God.
On June 21, 1591, Aloysius died
at the young age of 23. He was
canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in

=== Section ===
St. Aloysius de Gonzaga led a
life of humility and deep devotion to
God and to his fellow men. He was
a fine example of courage. Even
at a tender age, he denounced
earthly pleasures and fame.
He chose to suffer instead
of living the life of that of a prince. He chose to serve
instead of being served. And
having done so, he found God.

Fr. Theophiel Verbist
was a diocesan priest in the
archdiocese of Malines-Brussels in Belgium in the mid 18
th
century. He served as chaplain in the military academy in Brussels and at the same time as a national director of the Pontifical Association of the Holy Childhood. A compassionate man of God, he led a group of other Belgian diocesan priests who became deeply concerned with the abandoned children in China and with millions of Chinese who lived at that time in ignorance and poverty.
=== End ===

In 1862 he founded the
Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae (CICM) which
=== End ===

=== Section ===
translates to the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. Also known as the Scheut Mission, the congregation was born not knowing exactly what lies ahead. Their only assurance was their missionary zeal and God s providence. In the winter of 1865, Fr. Verbist with four zealous companions arrived in inner Mongolia, that immense territory north of the Chinese wall, which was entrusted to the fledging congregation by Rome, and where they immediately began organizing small Christian communities. The founding fathers never imagined that many would follow their footsteps notwithstanding the cost of traveling by sea and in the hinterlands of China. Three years later on Feb. 23, 1868, Fr. Verbist died of typhoid fever at the age of 45 in Lao-Hu-Kou.

His foundation grew into the worldwide presence it is today.

to the parties concerned.
Section 10. Evaluation of the Case.   In evaluating a report
=== End ===

=== Section ===
of complaint of sexual harassment, an attempt should be made to focus on the perspective of a person situated similarly to the accuser. The Committee should attempt to maintain confidentiality, however, a complainant should be told that complete anonymity may give way to the University s obligation to investigate and take appropriate action. Because it is important that every effort be made to keep the incident confidential, discretion should be exercised in determining which witnesses are indeed necessary to the investigation.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Section 11. Reasonable Man/Woman Standard.   In view of
=== End ===

=== Section ===
the fact that the perception of men and women may differ as to what constitutes harmless fun and what constitutes offensive conduct, the Committee shall adopt a  reasonable man/woman  rather than a  reasonable person  standard to determine whether conduct is unwelcome and sufficiently pervasive to amount to sexual harassment. Under this standard, the proper focus is on the victim s perspective of the given conduct and thus, in the typical case, a sexual harassment claim is proven if a reasonable man or woman would consider the harassment hostile or offensive.
=== End ===

=== Section ===
Section 12. Resolution of the Case.   The Committee, after
evaluation of the evidence submitted by the parties, shall submit its report and recommendation to the University President for the final resolution of the case.

Section 14. Liability of the Employer, Head of Office, Educational
or Training Institution.   The employer or head of office, educational or
training institution shall be solidarily liable for damages arising from the acts of sexual harassment committed in the employment, education or training environment if the employer or head of office, educational; or training institution is informed of such acts by the offended party and no immediate action is taken thereon in accordance with these rules.

=== Section ===
Section 15. Written Records and Privacy of Parties.   Careful
written records of cases of sexual harassment must be kept, but precautions should be taken to protect the privacy of all parties involved as much as possible.
