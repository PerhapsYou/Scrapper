" CONSOLIDATED POLICY ON THE USE OF PARKING SPACES , ' "IN THE MAIN CAMPUS 4 Academic Year 2017-2018 INTRODUCTION This parking policy seeks to clarify the regulations and restsictions on the use of parking spaces in the Main Campus of Saint Louis University for the benefit of the staff, students and visitors, in the light of the completion of the SLU Car Park Building, as well as the move of SLU to limit the entry of motor vehicles to achieve a safer, cleaner and greener campus. The policy applies to all staff, students, contractors and visitors, and covers the parking o of all ' motor vehicles in the Main Campus. ; BASIC PRINCIPLES e Despite the completion of the SLU Car Park Building, parking spaces in the campus remain . to be limited. e As the objective of SLU is to reduce the number of motor vehicles entering the Main Campus, and to convert the existing parking spaces to open green areas; employees will no longer be allowed to park in the Main Campus. However, in the meantime that the SLU Car Park Building is not yet fully operational, and that some infrastructure, beautification and regreening initiatives are yet to be implemented, employees  vehicles with valid parking permits shall still be allowed to park i in the Main Campus, still on a first-come first- served basis. e The construction, maintenance and operation of the SLU Car Park Building entail substantial costs. Thus, reasonable parking fees shall be assessed by the University to defray operational costs and any planned improvements to the Car Park Building. e At present, the SLU Car Park Building shall be limited for use by employees with valid parking permits specifically designed to access the said Car Park Building. e Visitors with prior arrangements with the University may also use the SLU Car Park Building. Only the Lower and Upper Ground Floors are presently available for use by SLU employees. The basement floor (along the Bonifacio-Rimando area) is not yet available .   for use. Due to limited parking spaces in the Main Campus, and conformably with existing parking guidelines on the matter, SLU employees assigned at the Hospital of the Sacred Heart are advised to use the parking spaces at the hospital area and not the SLU Car Park Building or the parking spaces in the Main Campus. Aside from the Car Park Building, the existing parking areas in the Main Campus may still be used by employees.in the meantime. The SLU Administration will announce the date when employees  vehicles will no longer be allowed in the Main Campus. Also, the parking spaces at the back of Otto Hahn Building (Gate.4) and those fronting the Del Baere Building (Gate 4) may likewise be used. Parking spaces near the Waldo Perfecto Gate (Gate 3) may likewise be utilized once the said gate is opened. Students with valid parking stickers may use the parking spaces at the back of Otto Hahn Building and those located at the Del Baere Building. - Students who wish to park at designated spaces should apply for permits with the CSSCO - ona semestral basis, provided, that: (a) they register a vehicle which is owned by them or their parents; and (b) they personally drive the said vehicle as their means of going to school. The CSSCO may limit the number of permits to be issued to students on a first- come first-served basis. Priority application for a Parking permit is granted to officers of the KASAMA-SSC Execom and the Governors of the various schools; provided, that this privilege shall be coterminous with their term of office and will be recalled once they resign, is impeached or is suspended.   Law and Graduate School students, as well as Pre-Bar Reviewees, with valid parking stickers may, in the meantime, continue to use the existing parking areas in the Main Campus, provided that the entry will be after 5:00 in the afternoon during weekdays (Mondays to Fridays). During Saturdays or Sundays, they may be allowed entry in the Car Park Building for the entire day, subject to the payment of appropriate fees. , Consultants/Contractors/Concessionaires . A parking permit only gives permission to look for a space. It does not guarantee that a space will be available. Thus, parking shall remain to be ona first-come first-served basis. To ease the problem on limited parking spaces, employees are strongly encouraged to carpool. Those who carpool may be eligible for parking discounts after proof of compliance with the requirements contained in this Policy. The University reserves the right to refuse even permit holders access to spaces in order to accommodate bona fide visitors for an organized event, or in the interest of safety and security, or for environmental considerations. SLU s commitment to protect the environment is an equally important consideration vis- a-vis the comfort of vehicle owners. The SLU Policy on Number Coding shall remain to be i in effect. SPECIFIC GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES A fon for a P 3 Pe r To secure a permit to park at the SLU Car Park Building, an application form shall be obtained from the Campus Safety, Security and Compliance Office (CSSCO) located at the - Diego Silang Building. Reasonable parking fees as determined by the SLU Finance Office : shall be levied and assessed ona semi-monthly basis, which can be paid either i in cash   or through salary deduction. Once the application process has been completed, the essco shall issue a sticker/tag to be placed at the windshield of the vehicle. Note that entry to or exit from the SLU Car Park Building will be restricted by an automatic barrier that will operate via the RFID system, and it is the sticker/tag which will allow the system to cause the barrier to automatically allow the entry or exit. The sticker/tag i is for one vehicle only and is non- transferable. Imposition of parking fees at the SLU Car Park Building shall commence during the Second . Semester of AY 2017-2018. The SLU Administration will announce if the new stickers/tags with RFID for the SLU Car Park Building is already available. In the meantime, employees May use their existing car stickers issued by the CSSCO to gain access to the SLU Car Park Building. Employee Parking The SLU Car Park Building is designed to accommodate various types of vehicles of employees. There are sections for motorcycles, smaller/compact cars and bigger cars/SUVs or vans. The employee must park at the designated space for the type of vehicle being parked. Consultants, contractors and concessionaires are required to comply with the University . policies on parking. Unless otherwise permitted, all consultants, contractors and concessionaires with valid transactions with the University should use the SLU Car Park Building. They are required to secure the necessary permits and stickers from the CSSCO after payment of the'prescrib ed fees therefor.

Entry of visitors shalt be in accordance with such prior arrangements set by the respective host office or events organizer and the CSSCO, and duly approved by the Administration. As parking spaces are limited, event organizers should encourage attendees to such events to consider using public transport or carpooling.

A parking permit granted to a PWD is not a guarantee of a parking sf space but entitles the holder to use such spaces when they are available. , ) PWDs who are not self-driving may be allowed drop-off only at the location nearest to the ' office/area they intend to.go to. Thereafter, the driver should park the vehicle in other available parking areas. Parking During Holidays As a general rule, parking within any premises of the University during holidays shall not be allowed, especially when there is a campus lockdown. Entry under exceptional and - clearly justified reasons shall only be allowed when there is prior clearance from the cssco.

Thus, everyone is directed to be vigilant and should take the following simple precautions: o Never leave a car door unlocked or a window open Do not leave any belongings on display in your car. Better yet, do not leave any valuables in your car Do not leave cash, credit cards or checkbooks Never leave your vehicle documents or other important documents in your car Double check that all doors and windows are locked before leaving the car Never leave your car s engine on while in the parking area. ie) Oo 0 010  To help maintain a safe University, immediately report any suspicious persons or incidents to the guard on duty, or to the CSSCO at any University line, local 376. .

REV F RFGBS/DJMC/JJVG/pay Administrative Memo No. 34, S. 2019 To : ALL DEANS, PRINCIPALS, HEADS OF OFFICES, FACULTY, AND STAFF Re : PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE ADOPTION OF AUSTERITY MEASURES Date : 20 September 2019 Greetings! Current projections on the availability of electricity and clean water are alarming. The only way to avert catastrophic scenarios is to judiciously use and conserve water and electricity. Studies have shown that as much as 10% of electric bills come from  vampire consumption  or power drain from appliances that are not in use but are plugged in electrical outlets. The United Nations predicts that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world's population could be living under water-stressed conditions. Using water-saving methods can reduce consumption by as much as 354. It is thus imperative that we, as a Louisian community, mindful of the CICM Mission of promoting Justice, Peace, and Integrity of Creation, collectively do our share in conserving electricity and water. Towards this end, everybody is enjoined to abide by the austerity measures outlined below: 1. Use of electricity a. All computers and other equipment shall be unplugged from the electrical outlet when not in use. It is not enough to switch them off, they must be unplugged. This rule, however, is not applicable for equipment that requires uninterrupted standby power to function properly or those that require continuous power. b. Lights should be turned off when not in use. This includes lunch breaks or at any time when the user will be out of the office for 30 minutes or more. c. Lights in comfort rooms should be switched off when not in use. d. Light should be turned off in hallways with natural daylight until sunset and should not be switched on unless sunlight is insufficient. e. Students are not allowed to stay in the classrooms after class except if duly authorized to do so. All lights should be switched off after each class. f. Everyone is reminded that playing computer games during office hours, or using office equipment or electricity for unauthorized purposes such as gaming, watching/ downloading movies or videos is an administrative offense. Also, the use of social media for personal reasons during office hours Is likewise prohibited. g. Personal equipment that consume electricity which are not duly authorized (such as but not limited to, microwave ovens, electric kettles, personal refrigerators, etc.) are prohibited. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY A Bonifacio Street Administrative Memo No. 5, s. 2019 2600 Baguio City Memo To : THE LOUISIAN COMMUNITY Re: OPENING OF THE BASEMENT LEVEL OF THE SLU CAR PARK BUILDING Date : 8 February 2019 The SLU Administration is pleased to announce the opening of the basement level of the SLU Car Park Building on 11 February 2019 which, with great optimism, will ease out some parking concerns we are experiencing in the main campus. With this, please be guided by the following: 1. The basement parking shall only open once the upper and middle levels of the car park building are filled up; Only one security guard will be stationed at the gate of this level. Everyone is advised to exercise extra caution since a guard s assistance when parking will not always be available. Further, everyone is required to properly park so as to occupy only one slot; Employees coming from the Rimando Road are strictly instructed to first proceed to the roundabout located in front of the Piao-Yan Building before entering the basement parking to avoid causing traffic; The following are reiterated for strict implementation and compliance: a.  no Car pass, no entry  policy; b. number coding scheme; c. car park building operating hours shall only be from 6:00am to 9:00pm, and d. only authorized vehicles are allowed to enter and park at designated areas in the main campus; Though the administration understands the need to find a parking space for your vehicle before you attend to your class/work, the succeeding acts, among others, shall not be allowed as punctuality is still expected from everyone: a. Parking in any of the driveways of the car park building while waiting for a vacant parking slot even if the employee will be on standby inside the vehicle; and, b. Forcing to double park or entering the main campus to park. The prohibition shall remain applicable even during non-class days. Ail other provisions of the Consolidated Parking Policy and its Amendments and Addendum that are not affected or modified by this Memo shall stand. For everyone s guidance and compliance.

CAMPAIGN AND MAXIMIZING THE USE OF EMAIL AND OTHER ELECTRONIC MEANS OF COMMUNICATION Date 18 September 2019 Greetings! As part of the continuing efforts of the University to protect the environment, everyone is advised to  think before you print.  Thus, before hitting the  print  button, let us all think first of the environment and determine if it is absolutely necessary to have a physical printout of the document to be printed. Further, in order to save on resources and facilitate University-wide electronic communication, all employees are required to secure their individual work email addresses. These work email addresses will be used for purposes of disseminating announcements, policies, guidelines, and other University-related communications. Moreover, everyone is also encouraged to utilize their work email addresses for work-related correspondence. All employees are therefore required to check their respective emails at least once a week (preferably more often) to see if new announcements, policies, guidelines, and other communications had been issued. It shall be the responsibility of all employees to do the regular checking of their emails, and failure to access the same will not excuse anyone for non-compliance. All Deans, Principals and Heads of Offices should ensure that their respective units have the necessary computer terminals for the faculty and staff to be able to check their emails. Employees who do not have yet their individual work email addresses must secure the same from the Technology Management and Development Department (TMDD) before 30 September 2019. Alternatively, the Deans, Principals and Heads of Offices may arrange with the TMDD a system of collectively securing the said individual email addresses of the employees within their respective units. Finally, all offices are likewise required to secure their office email address. Communications pertaining to the office itself must be coursed through the office email address and not the individual work email address of the concerned employee. The user credentials to the said office email shall be under the custody of the Head of Office, unless the email address more appropriately pertains to another person (e.g. Office Secretary/Clerk) within the unit. For everyone s guidance and compliance. REV FR GILBERT B SALES, CICM President RFGBS/AJRB/DJMC/pay i i r ano Use of water Report any leaking faucet or pipe immediately. When brushing, close the tap. Conserve water when washing dishes, or when cleaning laboratory materials. For the males, use the urinals in the comfort room instead of the toilets when urinating. Urinals consume less water than toilets. Refrain from flushing before using toilets or urinals except when necessary. Flushing should be done after using them and not before. Na nat repest flushing unless i is necessary. For toilets with flush lever, make sure that the lever returns to its original position after flushing. Letting the level at a depressed position wastes water. Newspaper and magazine subscriptions Newspaper and magazine subscriptions should be reviewed by offices if still necessary. Multinie subscriptions are discouraged. if the ottice has multipie subscriptions, the head of office shall decide which one to keep and shall immediately request for the termination of the subscription of the others. Suppiies Over-ordering of supplies, most especially for those with expiration date, should be avoided. In the laboratories, purchasing of chemicals should be based anly an projected use based on enrolment, bearing in mind that excess/expired chemicals are clifficult and expensive to dispose. it is best to have an updated inventory prior to ordering/purchasing. These guidelines shall be strictly enforced. The Heads of Offices, through the For everyone's guidance and compliance. environmental focal persons, are in charge of ensuring compliance with this Memo.
