The Center for Culture and the Arts was founded in May 1993 during the
presidency of Fr. Joseph Van den Daelen, who believed that in addition to
providing quality elementary, secondary, and tertiary education, SLU should also be
a place where cultural heritage and the arts are preserved and perpetuated. The
birth of the three resident performing groups of the center (Glee club, Dance
troupe, and the Tanghalang SLU) was only once a dream, but with its fruition, the

Center has enthralled the SLU and Baguio community with its first ever Broadway

1995,  West Side Story  in 1996,  The Fantasticks  in 1999, and school productions of
the greatly popular and celebra ted musicals  Les Miserables  in 2002 and 2003,
