Did you know that nine out of the last sixteen presidents of the Philippines were lawyers?
That’s not just a coincidence. The Philippines' Senate, House of Representatives, and top
businesses are driven by the expertise of lawyers. From champions of justice to advocates
for peace, lawyers play a crucial role in shaping society. 
More than ever, the world needs catalysts of change. We need people who are
knowledgeable about the law and those who can use this to create the good we are all
craving. At SLU School of Law, your dream of becoming a lawyer is not just a possibility,
it’s a high probability. Let us help you turn your aspirations into reality.
