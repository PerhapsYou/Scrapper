The American Corner Baguio was one of the 16th American corners in the Philippines. It was first established as American Thomas Jefferson Library, yet the year was undated since the corner was instilled as old. Later on, the name of the corner altered to American Studies Resource Center. And, in 2010, it was officially called as American Corner Baguio, which was located in the 4th floor of Msrg. Charles Vath Building inside the Library.

The American Corner Baguio gives the union of the Philippines and American spaces where students are able to explore American history, politics, arts, and cultures of the American.

Moreover, the corner was used for various public programs such as movie screenings to introduce US culture, US Embassy Talks for students’ research presentation, and discussions of English Language Teaching.

Also, this area offers the students a welcoming space where they can review, create school activities, read news or magazines and films related to America, and an exclusive access to the e-Library USA.

The American Corner Baguio will keep giving the academic community, SLU students, and the local Baguio City the most reliable, trustworthy, and complete information about the United States!

The Filipiniana Library houses publications on Philippine culture, literature, music, arts, ethnic groups, languages , history, politics, and government-published materials. This space in library also conducts displays/exhibits of its special collections, such as Cordillera books, Rizal Books, and Amianan Collections by Dr. Agcaoili of the University of Hawaii.

QS World University Rankings 2023 Affirms SLU’s Commitment to Excellence as a World-Class University

Rankings of Saint Louis University Indicate International Recognition

Saint Louis University has reinforced its status as a world-class university by being ranked by the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings as #103 in South-Eastern Asia and #651-700 in the top 1,500 universities in Asia. This affirmation is strengthened with SLU being rated as a Three Stars Institution for excellence after rigorous independent data collection and analysis of the QS Stars methodology performance metrics.

A comprehensive global ranking of the world’s top universities is published by QS Quacquarelli Symonds every year. Saint Louis University’s inclusion in the rankings makes it a standout study destination for international students. The QS World University Rankings are determined based on specific criteria: academic reputation, employer reputation, faculty/student ratio, citations per faculty, international student ratio, and international faculty ratio.

This SY 2021-2022,  SLU’s best features are employability, which means that SLU performs career service support to students, has a good employer reputation, and has a high employment rate; teaching, which means that the overall student satisfaction is high and faculty with doctorate degrees (PhD) is more than satisfactory; academic development,  which indicates that learning development centers are available for students, faculty development programs are in place, academic consultations are followed, and that SLU is a member of various international, regional, and national university networks;  and facilities which feature SLU’s aquatic facility, indoor fitness gym, indoor and outdoor sports court and field, bookstore, cafeteria, a support center for minority groups, religious facilities, student accommodation, library, health and support services, and student clubs and societies.

The QS Stars Methodology is a rating system that “aims to give prospective students an additional tool to use when choosing a university, providing deeper insights into individual institutions.” The QS three-star rating indicates national and international recognition for SLU. It affirms that the university maintains a high level of teaching and that its graduates are in high demand by employers. Moreover, the ratings show the institution’s excellent potential in achieving international education standards, undertaking complex research activities, and experimenting with pedagogical teaching.

QS Stars recognizes that universities are different from one another and therefore need to be assessed on a range of categories that recognize distinct strengths. Universities are rated on various factors within the rating system framework, including research, teaching, internationalization, academic development, online learning, innovation, arts and culture, facilities, graduate employability, social responsibility, inclusiveness, environmental impact, and specialist criteria.

This rating and ranking is yet again a proof of the concerted efforts of all the university units, and the strong support of the administration. This is true to SLU’s ​​ Strategic Objective 2.3 (Excellent Institutional Reputation is Recognized by Global Community).

Institutional Development and Quality Assurance (IDQA) officer, Mr. Hector Martin shared that SLU’s average this year is equivalent to 4 stars but SLU needs to improve on research and citations and in the number of nationalities in the student body.

Rev. Fr. Gilbert B. Sales, CICM,  President of Saint Louis University, expresses, “The 3 QS Stars and rating garnered by Saint Louis University mark the institution’s relentless mission in sustaining and providing Excellence and Quality Catholic Education to our stakeholders, most especially to the learners. The QS Stars we receive will be our guide to continuously drive for institutional development, enhance our brand reputation and recognition, attract more domestic and international students, and improve performance in key areas. I enjoin the whole Louisian Community to continuously work for the brand of excellence that is truly Saint Louis University. Cor Unum, et Anima Una!”

A scribble of light: SLU Talged Center hosts Matchstick Sessions on Creative Journaling

“As you light this match, we lend our spark and light the way for others.” – The Matchstick Sessions Creed

On 18 June 2025, the Saint Louis University (SLU) Talged Center conducted Matchstick Sessions 3 titled, “Creative Journaling: Fearless Self-Expression and Reflection.” The morning and afternoon sessions each gathered up to 12 Louisian students, all interested to learn creative ways to express themselves through journaling.

Opening the session with a welcome message was Justine S. Latawan, Talged Center Assistant. “Smile at the person next to you,” she began. “This is a brave space where you may have something new to explore or something you may have lost but found again. Another thing, be present,” she reminded.

Ms. Latawan introduced the Luminary of the Day, Rae Floresca-Rigonan, a Louisian alumna and former instructor at the BA Communication program. She has now fully embraced the craft as an artist, journaling workshop host, and co-founder of Notable Maria.

The symbolic Matchstick Ceremony then took place to officially begin the creative session. A candle was lit expressing the thought, “As you light this match, we lend our spark and light the way for others.”

Speaking to the participants, Rigonan expressed hope that after the creative journaling workshop, participants will “no longer be scared of a blank page” and that they’ll have more ideas what to write on the page.

The workshop began with a short talk about the creative process of journaling. Being both introspective and retrospective, journaling is a process of documenting thoughts, emotions, reflections, and personal experiences in written and visual form. As a tool for mental health, it aids understanding and processing feelings, reducing feelings of being overwhelmed and anxious. It emphasizes self-care and cultivates a positive self-image.

To start journaling, one needs writing materials, ephemera, space, motivation, consistency, and curiosity. Ephemera are items designed to be useful or important for only a short period of time, often within the duration of a specific event or purpose. Think flyers, tickets, brochures, pieces of paper, anything at all that can “preserve the moment.”

Several creative ways to fill journal pages include bullet journaling, collage journaling, art journaling, media journaling, reflective journaling, and creative journaling. Today, journaling extended to different niches: junk journals, travel journals, fitness journals, food journals, prayer journaling, morning pages, and more.

Each with their own journaling kit—complete with a guide, sticker sheets, a handful of trinkets, and thoughtful prompts—the participants set about crafting their pages with care. Whether inspired by a word, a thought, or a state of mind, each journaled and zoned in, embracing creativity and self-reflection.

After an hour, a “journal latag” took place where participants put their journals side-by-side for display, fostering the shared community experience.

“Your journal is your safe space. There is no perfect journal. You don’t have to be the best writer or artist in journaling. It’s your personal keepsake. You may or may not show it to the world but it is also good to inspire others how journaling has helped you in your daily life. Note that it is important that you begin, enjoy the process, and learn as you progress,” Rigonan encouraged.

Matchstick Sessions are rooted in the advocacy of sharing one’s passions within the community, offering individuals a space to explore themselves alongside others. This advocacy aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being, by promoting mental wellness, connection, and personal growth.

SLU officially launches ISO EOMS Project to strengthen quality management practices

Saint Louis University (SLU) through the Office of Institutional Development and Quality Assurance (OIDQA) officially launched the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Educational Organization Management System (EOMS) Project in alignment with ISO 21001:2018 standards.

The two-day initiative, from 19 to 20 June 2025 at the Cardinal Cardijn Hall in the SLU Student Residence Halls, is a pivotal milestone in the university’s commitment to a robust and effective Quality Management System (QMS). It features targeted training sessions designed to align their functions with EOMS core principles. Key participants include Process Owners (PO), Unit Document Controllers (UDC), and Internal Quality Auditors (IQA), all of whom play crucial roles in maintaining quality standards and institutional accountability.

Mr. Hector L. Martin, OIDQA Director, ushered in the program by presenting the updated EOMS policy manual, which was first introduced during the EOMS project kick-off in January 2025. The manual was formally endorsed through a ceremonial signing led by the SLU Administration through the Vice President for Administration, Atty. Shellah Yzanne P. Merced.

The signing was witnessed by School of Teacher Education and Liberal Arts (STELA) Dean Mary Pauline E. Namoca, PhD, RPsy; School of Advanced Studies (SAS) Dean Faridah Kristi Wetherick, PhD; School of Engineering and Architecture (SEA) Dean Engr. Jeffrey Des Binwag; and School of Medicine (SOM) Dean Dr. John Anthony Domantay, PhD.

The orientation of POs, UDCs, and IQAs followed, serving as a comprehensive introduction to the objectives, scope, roles, responsibilities, and implementation roadmap of the ISO EOMS-aligned QMS.

Mr. Teodoro V. Ramirez, Jr., Principal Consultant of AGF Consulting Group and resource person, discussed the key elements of ISO 21001:2018 Educational Organization Management System (EOMS), focusing on Documented Information as outlined in Clause 7.5. He further elaborated on several essential topics critical to implementing and maintaining an effective Quality Management System. These included Annex SL, which prescribes the standardized high-level structure for all ISO Management System Standards (MSS); the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) Cycle, a four-step method used to drive continuous improvement; Document Control Procedures to ensure consistency and accuracy of information; the Process Approach, which emphasizes managing interrelated activities as systems; and Knowledge Transfer, which supports organizational learning and sustainability.

Ramirez emphasized that “documentation is the trademark of your business process” and a fundamental part of best practices. Proper documentation ensures that standards are clearly defined and can be consistently applied across the organization. He also highlighted the importance of the Process Approach, describing it as a series of reproducible, interrelated activities that transform inputs—such as people, resources, or materials—into outputs that meet customer expectations. “The essence of quality is how operations are managed,” he said, underscoring that understanding and optimizing each process is key to ensuring consistent, high-quality outcomes across the institution.

The series of EOMS training will continue on 20 June 2025, focusing specifically on the capacity-building needs of Process Owners (POs) and Internal Quality Auditors (IQAs).

With the successful implementation of this initiative, SLU reaffirms its commitment to operational excellence and quality management, ensuring that its systems and practices meet international standards for quality education. This aligns closely with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education). Also, by strengthening institutional processes and accountability, SLU contributes to SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).

The Community Extension and Outreach Programs (CEOPO) serves as the supporting and coordinating arm for the development of the University’s extension and outreach programs. Its main task is to ensure that the University’s extension, outreach, and social services development agenda is carried out and well-organized. Specifically, it promotes collaboration among the different schools, offices and extension institutes and foundations in the University and provides support services so as to facilitate their extension endeavors.

SLU derives its mandate for extension and social services from its identity and role as an institution of higher learning with its trifocal functions of instruction, research, and extension. However, unlike state universities and colleges (SUCs) which are mandated specifically to align their programs in support of national, regional or local development plans (cf. RA 7722 or Higher Education Act of 1994, Sec. 2, Par.2), the University adopts a more liberal thrust for each extension programs. As CICM (Congregatio Immaculati Cordis Mariae / Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary) educational institution, it pursues its programs within the broader frame of the CICM missionary focus on the transformation of the world and the coming of the reign of God (CICM Constitutions Commentary, 1999) through its Justice, Peace, Integrity of Creation, and Indigenous Peoples’ Apostolate (JPIC-IPA).Guided by the vision of holistic development of peoples and community, the University commits itself to the educational, religious, cultural, socio-economic, political, health, and environmental development needs of its partner communities and the nation as a whole. However, as there are also other institutions working on each of these areas, the University endeavours to focus on particular needs that are least attended to especially those that are in line with CICM mission priorities and Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines’ JEEPGY Advocacies and insofar as its capacities can reasonably allow.As a higher education institution with expertise in teaching and research, it is precisely these specializations that the University brings to bear in its extension programs. Extension, however, is not a one-way traffic. As the University shares its expertise with the partner communities, a positive feedback is generated from the partner stakeholders and the process of extension itself, leading to more insights and questions on the state of knowledge. As theory meets practice, as formal knowledge meets casual needs, new impetus for knowledge generation and refinement shall ensue. This dynamic shall then enrich instruction and research within the University.

This weekly tradition fosters national and institutional pride, ecological awareness, and community involvement—all of which are central to SLU’s mission.

This is followed by the SLU Quality Policy Statement, fostering SLU’s dedication to excellence in education, research, and service, and the CICM Hymn, honoring missionary spirit.

A distinctive part of the Morning Rites is the Ecological Trivia, delivered by the designated host office for the week.

Following this is the Ecological Prayer, a shared invocation that reflects SLU’s deep commitment to environmental sustainability and ecological responsibility.

The ceremony concludes with the singing of the Saint Louis University Hymn, encapsulating the university’s ideals and aspirations and strengthening a shared sense of purpose across the SLU community.

Through the SLU Prayer for the Environment and Ecological Trivia, the program supports Climate Action (SDG 13) and Life on Land (SDG 15). Its emphasis on academic excellence and ethical leadership aligns with Quality Education (SDG 4) and Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions (SDG 16).

The SLU Sunflower Child and Youth Wellness Center (SCYWC) provides diagnostic psychotherapeutic intervention and psychological assessment for children with special concerns and those in special situations, and to work hand in hand with families, caregivers, and other helping professionals in providing systemic psychological assistance to children-clients.

The SLU Sunflower Child and Youth Wellness Center envisions itself as a community of socially involved professionals at the service of the welfare of children. With a Christian spirit of commitment, the staff and volunteers pool together their competencies, creativeness, and willingness to assist children and their families.

The SLU Sunflower Child and Youth Wellness Center responds to the need for psychosocial interventions for the children in the Cordillera region and nearby provinces, affirming the CICM and Saint Louis University’s commitment to the promotion of children’s welfare.

The Halfway Home provides programs and services for boys, 5 to 17 years old, who have experienced abuse, abandonment and/or neglect. It is a home strategically located halfway in their journey of healing and recovery while promoting their reintegration with capable family members, or possible referral to a child-caring institution that will care more permanently for their overall welfare.

For five years, the community-based Advocacy Project on Child Protection and Child Abuse Prevention has been operating in some communities of the Cordilleras. This academic year, given the restrictions of the pandemic, advocacy activities were mostly done online. The advocacy activities were conducted in close partnership with the local government units (LGU) and local organizations with same vision of promoting children’s welfare. Some of the Advocacy Programs are:

The project of establishing a center for psychosocial diagnosis and treatment for children goes back to the involvement of Fr. Geraldo Costa, CICM, in the ministry for street children in Metro Manila.From 1999 to 2000, Fr. Costa stayed at the Senden Home Residential Center in Binangonan, Rizal. While providing psychosocial assistance to the children in the center, Fr. Costa observed that most of the children possess an “open wound” that hinders them from flourishing to their full potential. Fr. Costa visited several other children’s institutions in Metro Manila seeking to understand what was observed in Senden Home. He noticed that that the “open wound” was a constant in most centers for children in special situations. In interviews with directors and staff of residential and temporary shelters, he noted two main unanswered problems: first, the need to help the children to overcome past traumatic experiences, and second, the need to help the children to recover their personal development, which may have been compromised by the hardships that the children encountered in their young life. In a visit to the United Nations Children’s Fund in Manila (UNICEF-Manila) and to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) in Metro Manila in 1999, the same concerns were expressed.In 2000, a study about the needs of the children in special situations in the Philippines, especially in Metro Manila, was presented by Fr. Costa to the RP-CICM Provincial Superior. As a response, the Provincial Superior approved a project proposal which would assist the shelters and institutions working with children in need of psychosocial assistance.From the school year 2001-2002, several steps were made towards the organization of a psychosocial therapeutic center for children. Firstly, weekly therapy sessions were given to the children of DSWD shelters in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). Secondly, senior students from the Department of Psychology of Saint Louis University (SLU) started volunteering at the Reception and Study Center for Children (RSCC) of DSWD in Puguis, La Trinidad, Benguet. Thirdly, active promotion of Children’s Rights in the SLU campus and in the areas of Baguio City and Benguet was accomplished. Fourthly, a small therapeutic playroom in the Home Sweet Home Compound was opened and children who need special attention and who also come from indigent families were welcomed for psychological assessment and intervention.In the beginning of 2003, Fr. Paul Van Parijs, CICM, then SLU President, proposed to Fr. Costa to stay in SLU and establish the project of a center for psychosocial diagnosis and treatment for children in Baguio City. The center would be working together with the Department of Psychology, the Clinical Pastoral Office, and the Guidance Center of the university. Despite that the first plan was to have the center in Manila, the RP-CICM Provincial Superior approved such proposal. Consequently, the services provided at that time in the small playroom in Home Sweet Home could be extended.In March 18, 2003, the Child and Youth Wellness Center (CYWC) of Saint Louis University was officially inaugurated in the Home Sweet Home compound. A room of the old Catholic Press was transformed in three small offices and a room for therapeutic sessions.By the school year 2003-2004, two courses related to the clinical approach in handling children’s cases were offered in the Graduate Program of Psychology, namely, Clinical Interventions for Children (Psych 232), and Psychotherapy for Children (Psych 233). The students enrolled therein had a hands-on application of the theories they had learned by holding actual therapeutic sessions in the Center. The courses are offered every two years, thus, increasing the number of child therapists serving children in need of psychosocial assistance.In April 15, 2011, the Sunflower on the Hill was inaugurated in Bukal ng Tipan, Maryhill, Taytay, Rizal. The staff and volunteers pool together their competencies, creativeness, and willingness to assist children and families in the areas of Rizal, Antipolo, and other nearby provinces. Meanwhile, the Sunflower Centennial Halfway Home for Boys was officially inaugurated in April 28, 2011. The Halfway Home provides program and services for boys have experienced abuse, abandonment and/or neglect.In 2015, there was a proposal for an advocacy project focusing on child protection and prevention against abuse in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). The project was spearheaded by the SLU Sunflower Child and Youth Wellness Center in partnership with the Flinders University of South Australia students, the CJ Moran Community Legal Assistance Office of the SLU School of Law, SLU Social Work Department, Municipality of Kibungan, Benguet, and the Municipality of Mankayan, Benguet. As the years passed, other international partners were involved to include the Australian Volunteers for International Development (AVID) and the US Peace Corps (USPC). Indeed, the SLU Sunflower Child and Youth Wellness Center has grown and is continuously growing. Our history will show how far the center has gone and how far it will go as it continues to make a mark as an institution dedicated to providing assistance to children of the Cordilleras and beyond.

Aside from its local performances, the group has also been performing in several places in the Philippines and astounded the international audience with its tours in California, U.S.A; Guangzhou, China; Belgium; Buriram, Thailand; Jinju, South Korea and recently in Busan South Korea. The company’s exposure to thriving artistry, combined with the university’s support, has strengthened the SLU Dance Troupe position within the Arts Community.

Saint Louis University (SLU), through its University Research and Innovation Center (UnRIC), reaffirmed its commitment to promoting health and well-being by hosting the 13th Regional Health Research Conference (RHRC) for the third time on 19-20 June 2025 at the Rev. Fr. Theophile Verbist Hall, SLU Sacred Heart Medical Center.

With the theme “BINNADANG for One Health,” the conference—led by the Cordillera Regional Health Research and Development Consortium (CRHRDC) under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) —served as a strategic platform to advance public health through stronger local research, cross-sector collaboration, and evidence-based solutions to the region’s key health challenges.

SLU President and 2025 CRHRDC RHRC host, Rev. Fr. Gilbert B. Sales, CICM, PhD, represented by the Vice President for Academic Affairs Felina P. Espique, PhD, expressed how the conference highlights the relevance of the word “binnadang” in connecting people for the betterment of the community, particularly in health. “This conference, therefore, is more than just a scholarly event. It is a platform for transformative engagement where we come together to explore groundbreaking ideas, showcase innovative research, and strengthen collaborative efforts for a healthier Cordillera and beyond,” Dr. Espique said.

Representatives from the four CRHRDC pillars gave inspirational messages for the guests and participants. Among them were the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) CAR Regional Director and CRHRDC Governing Board Chair, Atty. Septon A. De La Cruz, represented by Education Supervisor II Godfrey G. Mendoza, PhD; the Department of Health (DOH) CAR Regional Director and CRHRDC Governing Board Co-chair, Dr. Ferdinand Benbenen; DOST-CAR Regional Director and CRHRDC Governing Board Secretary, Nancy A. Bantog, PhD; and University of the Philippines (UP) Baguio Chancellor and CRHRDC Governing Board Member Joel Addawe, PhD. These notable speakers shared insights that encouraged delegates to address current gaps in educational research and become catalysts for change, highlighting the importance of linking academia and health to shape a better future.

The “3-Minute Pitch” showcased exceptional research papers that aimed to bridge the gap between research and policy while addressing the health concerns in the community. Afterward, the opening of the exhibits and the ribbon cutting ceremony were held.

Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) Executive Director, Dr. Jaime C. Montoya, then delivered his keynote address that tackled how research can help people develop solutions and combat health issues. “We encourage inclusion of local voices in Health Research. People and scientists coming from diverse fields working as one team because we believe that everyone can offer something new, and all of us can learn from each other,” he emphasized. Dr. Montoya added the interconnectedness of the biological ecosystem and how one variable can affect another.

The CRHRDC’s members then took their Pledge of Commitment that serves as a reminder to continue their shared mission of advancing research. Following this, the Professional category for the Podium Presentation competition and the Poster Presentations were held.

On the second day, 20 June, the World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines Health Emergencies Team Technical Staff, Ms. Rowena Capistrano, opened the series of sessions with her presentation titled, “Bridging the Gaps: Integrating Human, Animal, and Environmental Health for a Resilient Future.” She elaborated on health concerns anchored on the global situation, emphasizing the essential steps to achieve health security. “A multidisciplinary and multisectoral One Health approach can protect global health security,” she said.

Dr. Ronald Law, Director III of DOH Health and Climate Change Office, discussed “Climate Change and Its Ripple Effects: Impacts on Human, Animal, and Environmental Health” on a national level. “We need to do both mitigation and adaptation,” he stated, highlighting the country’s need to improve in preventing health issues.

In the third session, Dr. Donnabel T. Panes, CRHRDC Research Utilization Committee (RUC) Chair, talked about “From Mountains to Medicine: Indigenous Knowledge and One Health in the Cordillera: Lessons from Traditional Practices.” She explained the relevance and impact of incorporating Indigenous Knowledge Systems into actively co-creating solutions with communities. “These are our strengths. We just have to maximize the indigenous knowledge that has been given to us,” Dr. Panes said, promoting inclusive education and indigenous adaptations.

The student category of the Podium Presentation competition and the Health Research Ethics Forum were held simultaneously at the Verbist Hall and the Yabut Conference Hall of the SLU SHMC.

Dr. Erlinda C. Palaganas, CRHRDC Regional Coordinator, officially opened the awarding ceremony with an inspiring message that called on participants to move forward and nurture a culture of inquiry rooted in passion. “Let us build bridges across disciplines, regions, and ideologies. Let us make the Cordillera not only a region of rich culture and resilient communities but also a beacon of research excellence and ethical leadership,” she emphasized.

Following the recognition of member institutions, the awarding ceremony formally commenced.

In closing, Ms. Rowena C. Madarang, CRHRDC Consortium Director, summarized the essential points made by the keynote speakers and presenters. She mentioned how each research contributed to the collective pursuit of better health and well-being. She said, “We celebrated not just the research but the passion and ingenuity behind each project.”

SLU’s participation and collaboration in the Conference is a testament to its unwavering commitment to promoting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) No. 3 (Good health and Well-being), 4 (Quality Education), 13 (Climate Action), 15 (Life on Land), 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), and 17 (Partnership for the Goals).

The main role of the SLU Parish is to assist in the realization of the vision, mission and goals of Saint Louis University and of the Diocese of Baguio, through the empowerment of its students, faculty, non-teaching personnel and administrative personnel. As a Christian community, SLU Parish seeks to stimulate, nurture and challenge one another spiritually and intellectually through its ministries in order to live a Christ-centered life.  It is a full-pledged parish, and not merely a chaplaincy, with all the programs and sacramental responsibilities of such. The hope of the Parish at SLU is to form small groups of Christian disciples who worship, hear God’s Word and become Good news for each other, building therefore a new world order according to God’s plan.

We envision the SLU Parish as a committed, creative, and dynamic missionary community of Christian disciples dedicated to an enhanced spiritual formation, youth empowerment, social involvement, and competence training.In line with the core values of Saint Louis University, the objectives of the SLU Parish shall be the following:

Alongside the religious education formally given in the classrooms, students are given ample chances to participate in spiritual-liturgical and missionary-pastoral activities in the University under the guidance and animation of the Parish Team.Among the regular activities meant to sustain the Christian growth and maturity of the students are recollections, seminars, Bible study, outreach programs, social action campaigns, and even one-on-one spiritual direction. Liturgical services that are offered are the daily Masses, Weddings, Baptisms and Confessions. Moreover, various parish organizations are open for those who wish to commit themselves to specific services under the parish’s programs and objectives.Categorized below are some of the programs and services offered by the Parish Office in coordination with the Center for Campus Ministry and with the approval from the Office of the Vice President for Mission and Identity:

When Saint Louis became a University in 1963, it took some years before there was an official chaplaincy. The first chaplain was then Fr. John De Cloedt who was succeeded for a while by Fr. Evarist Verlinden. In 1969, Msgr. William Brasseur allowed baptisms and marriages to be administered in the SLU Chapel. Thus, according to the books, the first baptism (an adult baptism) was administered on March 2, 1969 and the first marriage was celebrated on October 20, 1969.On May 15, 1971, Fr. John Ameye received his official appointment as chaplain of SLU. It was Fr. John who worked hard to prepare all the papers for the official erection of the SLU Parish which would be the first University in the country to become a personal parish. August 12, 1972 was the red letter day for the SLU Parish. On that day, Msgr. William Brasseur officially erected the parish and appointed Fr. John as the first Parish Priest.Fr. John held office at the Jose Burgos Building and published a weekly liturgical bulletin. Unfortunately, during the Aguinaldo masses of 1973, Fr. John got a heart attack and had to be brought to a hospital in Makati. This ended Fr. John’s parish work in SLU.Fr. James Desmet, who was then the head of the Religion Department became the ad interim parish priest until Fr. Wilfried Daels arrived in September 1974. Fr. Wilfried continued the work of Fr. John and established the SLU Parish Council. Fr. Daels did not stay long because in June 1975 he went for a home vacation and got a new assignment upon his return from Belguim. Agaim, Fr. James kept the parish open until the CICM Provincial created a Pastoral Team for the SLU pArish on March 18, 1976. Fr. Luc Colla and Fr. John Slegers were the team members, and Fr. James Desmet was the team coordinator as per appointment by the Bishop.Fr. John Slegers, who was the former Secretary General of the University, worked together with Fr. James on the College level while Fr. Luc Colla, who was appointed in SLU in January 22, 1976 took care of all the pastoral work in the Elementary and High School Departments. Upon the opening of the SLU hospital on May 10, 1977, Fr. James and Fr. Luc became the Hospital Chaplains.On June 20, 1979, Fr. John Slegers was called to help out in St. Louis College in Tuguegarao. Fr. August Bellens took his place. Fr. Bellens, as member of the pastoral team, helped out in the parish, taught Scripture and cared for the chaplaincy in the SLU Sacred Heart Hospital. Unfortunately, on account of his poor health, Fr. Bellens left for Home Sweet Home on May 4, 1986. A few days later, on May 8, 1986, Fr. Andres Nowe arrived as the new team member. He continued the work of Fr. Bellens in the hospital; helped out in the parish and started teaching. On September 1, 1986, Fr. Gerard Helsen became a full time chaplain in the SLU Hospital. On October 20, 1986, Fr. Andres Nowe took over as a parish priest from Fr. James Desmet who left for his new assignment as chaplain in St. Louis College, San Fernando, La Union. October of the same year, Fr. Andres became the Parish Priest until April 1995 and the head of the Religion Department.In 1995, the Religion Department became the Institute of Philosophy and Religion (IPR) with Fr. Paul Van Parijs, CICM as head. On the same year,  the IPR separates from the Parish. Fr. Crisanto Draculan, a diocesan priest from Pangasinan functioned as the Parish Priest and the Spirit of Love Catholic Community Spiritual Director.  An ad-hoc parish council was implemented with 2 faculty appointees per college and 2 youth representatives. Fr. Gerard de Boeck, CICM also became the Hospital Chaplain.

SLU gears up for AY 2025–2026 with Calendar Summit and Structural Reorganization rollout

In preparation for the Academic Year 2025-2026, Saint Louis University convened its heads of offices for the Calendar Summit and Structural Reorganization Presentation on 16 June 2025 at the Fr. Francis Gevers Hall, Diego Silang Building, SLU Main Campus. The event aimed to streamline institutional planning by aligning academic schedules and priorities to ensure efficient implementation of key programs and initiatives.

Atty. Shellah Yzanne P. Merced, Vice President for Administration, set the direction in her opening, emphasizing that the summit “ensures transparency, seamlessness, and efficiency.” Shortly after, University Registrar, Andrew Macalma, PhD, presented the overview of the drafted academic calendar as well as the scheduling guide. The different clusters then had breakout sessions to discuss, decide on, and map out their respective university-wide, cluster, and unit-level activities.

In the afternoon, the updated organizational structure was presented to further reinforce institutional accountability and alignment. “Reorganization is crucial for us, as an organization, to adapt to changing circumstances, improve efficiency, and ensure long-term viability. It allows us to streamline operations, to ensure greater alignment between SLU and its stakeholders, and even manage internal issues like inefficiencies or redundancies. It empowers us to operate more efficiently, foster innovation, and enhance employee satisfaction,” Atty. Merced said.

To provide a clearer understanding of SLU’s organizational structure, Felerina Ellamil, PhD, Job Analysis Project Consultant, gave a walk through of the pivotal movements and shifts in the leadership structure. The presentation showed how all units are aligned with the university’s strategic direction and are equipped with a solid grasp of the changes, enabling heads to effectively cascade information and updates to their respective teams. It also clarified how the reorganization impacts each office’s mandate and operations in relation to the University’s overall structure, ensuring that plans are supported by the appropriate systems and resources. Furthermore, the presentation highlighted the importance of coordination and collaboration across units to ensure streamlined operations, seamless processes, and efficiency.

After some clarifications from unit heads on the revised organization structure, Vice President for Finance Roberto Arguelles, PhD discussed how re-organization impacts the University’s strategic direction, highlighting that an organization’s structure should be designed to effectively implement its strategic goals. “A well-aligned structure facilitates communication, coordination, collaboration, and the efficient allocation of resources to achieve those goals,” he said. The new structure encourages a culture that embraces change, values community, and builds leadership based on respect — not on rules or position, he explained.

As SLU sets its course for the coming academic year, the summit reaffirmed the university’s commitment to shared leadership and organizational agility. Such undertakings are aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 4 (Quality Education), 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), and 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

Saint Louis University (SLU) welcomed over two hundred school leaders and representatives for the 2025 Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education (GASTPE) Regional Orientation Conference.

Spearheaded by the Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) and hosted by SLU through the leadership of SLU President and PEAC Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) Regional Program Director, Rev. Fr. Gilbert B. Sales, CICM, PhD, the orientation tackling the implementation of the Education Service Contracting (ESC), Teachers’ Salary Subsidy (TSS), and Senior High School (SHS) Voucher Program for the School Year (SY) 2025-2026 was held at the Fr. Francis Gevers Hall, SLU Main Campus, on 19 June 2025.

Fr. Sales officially welcomed the participants, underscoring their crucial role in shaping the future of education. He also emphasized the importance of adhering to the various guidelines set by the committee in delivering educational services. “Let us view this orientation as an opportunity to reinforce our collective commitment to quality and compliance,” he remarked.

Thereafter, Silliman University and Association of Christian Schools, Colleges and Universities  President Betty Cernol-McCann, PhD; Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Sen. Juan Edgardo “Sonny” M. Angara; and Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities President Marco Alfredo M. Benitez also delivered messages of gratitude to the participants. They expressed appreciation for the support and cooperation in ensuring that the Region continues to provide quality education and services. Furthermore, they encouraged each school representative to continue cultivating young learners’ minds.

Meanwhile, DepEd-CAR Regional Director Estela L. Cariño, PhD, represented by DepEd-CAR Assistant Regional Director Ronald B. Castillo, PhD, affirmed the Department’s shared responsibility with PEAC in solving 21st century challenges within the educational sector.

PEAC Executive Director Rhodora Angela F. Ferrer, PhD, then shared updates on  the GASTPE Workplan, specifically on a regional level. She presented statistics showcasing data on the number of grantees, subsidies, and certification activities conducted. Dr. Ferrer also commended the region’s improvement in guidelines implementation and good performance.

During the conference, the Education Service Contracting (ESC) Schools certified in SY 2024-2025 were also recognized. ESC is a partnership program by the DepEd geared at decongesting overcrowded public junior high schools. A certified ESC school is one that has complied with all DepEd standards and policies and meets the requirements of the self-study procedure prescribed by the PEAC National Secretariat ESC Certification Unit.

The Information Security and Data Privacy Protection, tackled by Mr. Grevered L. Gallego, Unit Head of Organizational Planning and Quality Assurance, informed the educators on their responsibilities for data processing and protection of students. “Do not collect what you cannot protect,” he stated, urging the participants to take information security compliance seriously and with integrity.

In the afternoon, the Unit Head of the Monitoring and Processing Unit, Mr. Rodrick Edsel B. Malonzo, discussed the Processing of Documents and monitoring of the participating schools. He explained the processing of billing statements and management systems that the schools must incorporate and maintain. Moreover, Mr. Malonzo enumerated the eligibility and requirements for ESC and TSS grantees.

A question and answer portion was held afterward, where the participants engaged in meaningful dialogue, and the speakers provided clarifications.

Through the Conference, SLU reaffirmed its commitment to promoting and sustaining quality education with strong partnerships. As Fr. Sales stated in his message, “Together, we can continue to advance the private education sector and ensure that every learner receives a truly transformative educational experience.” By ensuring that the learning institutions meet and maintain the given standards, the dreams of Filipino students are also empowered.

The Conference also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) No. 4 (Quality Education), 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions), and 17 (Partnerships for the goals). (Article by Ydelvess Faith Morales, UIO Volunteer | Photos by Kyla Moreno, UIO Volunteer)

As part of the program for the preservation, development, and celebration of Cordillera performing arts, the Museum-Center runs a training program on traditional Cordillera performing arts for students from the various ethnic groups of the Cordillera region for them to appreciate, develop, and practice their traditional performing arts. The students who take part in the training workshops are recognized and inducted as members of the Cordillera Cultural Performing Group (CCPG), the living tradition component of the Museum-Center that sustains and showcases the traditional performing arts of the Cordillera ethnic groups.

For this purpose, the Museum-Center provides a training facility, complete with traditional musical instruments, paraphernalia and attires for rehearsals. A training program is collaboratively implemented with the alumni of the CCPG, who serve as experts and bearers of Cordillera traditional performing arts, together with other recognized experts in this area.

The IP Students Center is located within the Museum where university students coming from the various minority ethnic groups or indigenous peoples of the Cordillera region can come to socialize with each other and/or share/discuss about their common issues and concerns as well as those of the wider indigenous peoples in the region and beyond. This also contains a mini-library containing materials on Cordillera societies, cultures, histories, and languages for consultation and learning by the IP students and other interested parties.

ANTENA is an international project that aims to increase the academic quality and research ofuniversities in the Philippines through the development of internationalization capacities.

In order to achieve this objective, ANTENA strives for consolidated internationalization structure. Also, it endeavors to build human capacities of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) through targeted training programmes in 10 HEIs which include Saint Louis University.

As a structural project, ANTENA targets to support the governance reforms of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and to enhance international networking through strategic actions in key areas of the Philippine higher education system.

The FRIENDS project title stands for Furthering International Relations Capacities and Intercultural Engagement to Nurture Campus Diversity and to Support Internationalization at Home. The project is built around the concept of Internationalization at Home (IaH) that reframes the traditional perceptions of higher education internationalization in the five partner countries involved, namely Bhutan, Cambodia, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand. The notion of IaH is based on the assumption that for various reasons, the largest part of the university student body will remain non-mobile and therefore deprived from access to global knowledge and skills.

This consortium will be the avenue to operationalize SEA-TVET activities in order to achieve its goals:(1) to leverage the standard and competency of TVET in Southeast Asia through internationalization and harmonization;(2) to promote and develop the curriculum harmonization, and internationalization of study programs through lecturer/student exchange, joint research programs and industrial linkages; and(3) to create a sustainable networking platform among TVET leaders and institutions in Southeast Asia and industry, as well as other related development agencies.SEA-TVET Consortium comprises Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions in SEAMEO Member countries that agree to work together in harmonizing and internationalizing their programs through curriculum harmonization, students and staff exchange, and industrial attachment, and resource sharing. This consortium is formed to secure commitment from participating institutions and industries to work together towards achieving the following objectives:– To create networking among TVET providers;– To provide opportunities for participating institutions to work together in student and staff exchangeand industrial attachment; and– To share best resources/practices and to generate new/innovative ideas through researchcollaboration.

The SEA Teacher Project or the “Pre-Service Student Teacher Exchange in Southeast Asia” is a project that aims to provide opportunity for pre-service student teachers from universities in Southeast Asia to have teaching experiences (practicum) in schools in other countries in Southeast Asia. Based on the SEAMEO, seven priority areas for the 11 SEAMEO Member countries to work together to improve the quality of education in Southeast Asia, “Revitalizing Teacher Education” is one of the priority areas in building and strengthening capacity of teachers in the region.

The Center for Campus Ministry is a form of an exercise of the ministry of the Word of God, which contains services and activities that are meant for the Christian formation of the students and employees. The Center provides spiritual enrichment and formation of the Louisian community such as recollections, formation sessions.It is the liturgical and sacramental expression of our vocation that is uniquely missionary. It is an external manifestation of what lies deeply within one’s faith through celebrations and liturgical services. In campus ministry, we find the communion between the interior (vocation) and that which students encounter in their life-journeys (religious education). Campus ministry locates the stage where the soul encounters reason. It is the manifestation of theology learned and spirituality applied.

We, the CICM Campus Ministers, called by Jesus Christ and inspired by the CICM charism, envision a vibrant faith-filled community, through meaningful Liturgical Celebrations, relevant Religious Instructions, transformative Social Involvement and intensified Vocation-mission Animation.

The Vision-Mission of the CICM Campus Ministry provides the general framework of the services rendered by the Campus Ministry Office of each CICM school. These are:

In 1907, the CICM Missionaries arrived in the Philippines, mandated by the Holy See to evangelize the northern part of the country. Pretty soon, it became apparent that Baguio, then a small mountain village resort in the province of Benguet, around two hundred and fifty kilometers north of Manila, will be pivotal for the region. With an elevation of at least 1,500 meters above sea level, Baguio is a natural gateway to and from the Cordillera mountain range, which traverses the Mountain Provinces (Montañosa), the home of numerous indigenous tribes.

Thus it was that in 1911, Rev Fr Séraphin Devesse, CICM, founded a one-room elementary school in Baguio for ten local boys. From these humble origins, Saint Louis School began.

In 1915, the intermediate grades and a trade school were started under the guidance of Fr. Florimond Carlu, CICM.

In 1952, college-level courses in the Liberal Arts and Commerce were offered, and Saint Louis College had its first Rector. Other courses and further developments soon followed, under the guidance of the following CICM Rectors/Presidents-

In 1955, the graduate-level programs of Saint Louis College were granted recognition, but the real turning point came on 13 May 1963, when Saint Louis College was conferred University status by the Philippine Government.

From the one-room Saint Louis School for ten boys in 1911, Saint Louis University has grown to a four-campus University with more than thirty buildings catering to more than thirty thousand students.

We envision Saint Louis University as an excellent missionary and transformative educational institution zealousin developing community-oriented and globally-recognized Louisian professionals who are innovative, competent, compassionate, imbued with Christian spirit, and empowered to build a just, peaceful, and sustainable society.

We are committed to developing community-oriented and globally-recognized Louisian professionalswho are innovative, competent, compassionate, imbued with Christian spirit, and empowered to build a just, peaceful, and sustainable society. We, in partnership with our stakeholders, are committed to implementing an effective quality management systemand continual improvement to meet all applicable requirements towards the utmost satisfactionof our valued Louisian community.

Founded on Saint Louis University’s distinctive “Sapientia Aedificat” and on CICM’s motto, “Cor Unum et Anima Una” (One Heart, One Soul), the unified Louisian family highlights its pursuit of excellence in order to be of service to the community. Each Louisian is inspired to embody the following values:

INNOVATION: Innovation fosters lifelong learning and the pursuit of self-actualization. By inspiring new ideas and outputs, it aligns with SLU’s commitment to creativity and adaptability in a changing world.

COMPETENCE: Competence highlights the importance of excellence in professional practice and everyday life. By striving to exceed established standards with integrity, it encourages both students and faculty to pursue personal and professional growth.

COMPASSION: Compassion highlights the need to commit to delivering acts of kindness that uplift marginalized and vulnerable communities, while promoting justice, peace, and the integrity of creation.

CHRISTIAN SPIRIT: This value emphasizes modeling Christ-like character by embodying Catholic teachings and advocating for service to others, serving as a guiding principle that fosters a faith-driven and compassionate university community.

CHIEF JUSTICE MANUEL V. MORAN COMMUNITY LEGAL ASSISTANCE OFFICE (CJMM CLAO)

On April 18, 2015, the Chief Justice Manuel V. Moran Community Legal Assistance Office (CJMM CLAO) was formally launched through the initiative of former SLU President Rev. Fr. Jessie M. Hechanova and former SOL Dean Jason R. Barlis. It is the official legal aid office of SLU and a pioneer in the institutionalization of a structured legal aid clinic in Baguio and in Benguet.

Having named in the honor of Chief Justice Manuel V. Moran, a champion in advancing the cause of the poor, the CJMM CLAO is committed to ensuring equal access to justice for all members of the community by offering a wide range of legal services, including representation in court, legal advice and counselling, and community legal education. To create a meaningful change through community outreach, CJMM CLAO works to promote and protect the legal rights of the vulnerable and marginalized individuals through collaboration and partnerships with other organisations to effect broader systemic change.

Since its inception in 2015, the CJMM CLAO has served more than 4,000 individuals through community-based activities, including seminars and trainings, court representations, jail visit activities, and free legal aid program. At present, CJMM CLAO has five legal clinics namely: the Women and Children’s Rights Clinic, Labor and Worker’s Rights Clinic, Litigation Clinic, Transactional Clinic and the Green Clinic. These five (5) clinics are significant in giving essence to the CJMM CLAO’s mission of advocating, advancing, and protecting the rights of some of the marginalized sectors of our society. In addition to these clinics, the CJMM CLAO also undertakes mediation through the Community Dispute Resolution Center and a continuing partnership with the Bureau of Jail and Management Penology (BJMP) of Baguio City in rendering legal assistance to persons deprived of liberty (PDLs).

The CJMM CLAO continues to thrive, propelled by the dedicated efforts of its esteemed past directors: Atty. Jose Adrian M. Bonifacio (2015-2016), Atty. Jennifer N. Asuncion (2016-2018), Atty. Yasmine Lee R. Tadeo (2018-2020), Atty. Bernadette C. Mendoza (2020), and Atty. Jason R. Barlis (2020-2021). Under the current leadership of SOL Dean Jerico G. Gay-ya, and current CJMM CLAO Director Atty. Victoria P. Dines, with the support of SLU President Rev. Fr. Gilbert B. Sales and the SLU Administration, the legal aid office perseveres in its mission to safeguard rights and ignite positive change in the lives it touches.
