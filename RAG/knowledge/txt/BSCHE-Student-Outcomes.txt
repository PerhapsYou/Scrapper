SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY  
BS CHEMICAL ENGINEERING PROGRAM  
STUDENT OUTCOMES  

==========================================================================  
Upon graduation, the students should be able to:

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome a:  
Apply knowledge of mathematics, natural science, engineering  
fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of  
complex engineering problems.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome b:  
Conduct investigations of complex engineering problems using  
research-based knowledge and research methods, including the design  
of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of  
information to provide valid conclusions.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome c:  
Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design  
systems, components, or processes that meet specified needs with  
appropriate consideration for public health and safety, cultural,  
societal, and environmental considerations.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome d:  
Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in  
diverse teams and in multidisciplinary settings.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome e:  
Identify, formulate, research literature, and analyze complex  
engineering problems, reaching substantiated conclusions using first  
principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome f:  
Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and  
responsibilities and norms of engineering practice.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome g:  
Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the  
engineering community and with society at large; this includes  
comprehension and writing of effective reports and design documentation,  
delivering effective presentations, and giving and receiving clear  
instructions.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome h:  
Understand and evaluate the sustainability and impact of professional  
engineering work in the solution of complex engineering problems in  
societal and environmental contexts.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome i:  
Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage  
in independent and lifelong learning in the broadest context of  
technological change.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome j:  
Apply reasoning informed by contextual knowledge to assess societal,  
health, safety, legal, and cultural issues, and the consequent  
responsibilities relevant to professional engineering practice and  
solutions to complex engineering problems.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome k:  
Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern  
engineering and IT tools, including prediction and modeling, to complex  
engineering problems, with an understanding of their limitations.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome l:  
Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of engineering management  
principles and economic decision-making, and apply these to one’s own  
work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and function  
in multidisciplinary environments.

BS Chemical Engineering Program – Student Outcome m:  
Practice Christian values in their personal and professional endeavors  
as Louisians in the service of the CICM mission.
