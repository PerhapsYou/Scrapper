================================================================================  
Upon graduation, the students should be able to:

BS CIVIL ENGINEERING PROGRAM STUDENT OUTCOME a:  Apply knowledge of mathematics, natural science, engineering fundamentals,  
      and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems.

BS CIVIL ENGINEERING PROGRAM STUDENT OUTCOME b:  Conduct investigations of complex engineering problems using research-based  
      knowledge and methods, including the design of experiments, analysis and  
      interpretation of data, and synthesis of information to provide valid conclusions.

BS CIVIL ENGINEERING PROGRAM STUDENT OUTCOME c:  Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design systems,  
      components, or processes that meet specified needs with appropriate consideration  
      for public health and safety, as well as cultural, societal, and environmental factors.

BS CIVIL ENGINEERING PROGRAM STUDENT OUTCOME d:  Function effectively as an individual and as a member or leader in diverse teams  
      and multidisciplinary settings.

BS CIVIL ENGINEERING PROGRAM STUDENT OUTCOME e:  Identify, formulate, research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems,  
      reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural  
      sciences, and engineering sciences.
