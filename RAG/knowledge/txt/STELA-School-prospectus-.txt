The School of Teacher Education and Liberal Arts (STELA) is envisioned as an institution for excellence in Teacher and Liberal Arts Education committed to the CICM mission of education of “missio et excellentia” in the formation and training of competent, creative, socially-involved professionals imbued with Christian Spirit.

VISION  
Christian Spirit  
1. To develop teachers who are imbued with a Christian philosophy of education, cognizant of the dignity of all learners;  
2. To develop a sense of responsibility and sensitivity for others in the spirit of Christian understanding and brotherhood thus, inculcating the CICM missionary perspective of the option for the poor and the non-Christian.

MISSION  
The School of Teacher Education and Liberal Arts goes back to its roots from two separate schools from Saint Louis University. The School of Teacher Education houses the Professional Education Programs, while the School of Humanities is home of the Liberal Arts programs.

In academic year 2016–2017 and under the visionary leadership of Rev. Fr. Gilbert B. Sales, CICM, both schools have been strategically merged to intensify the learning experience of students and promote camaraderie within the Louisian Community.

GOALS AND OBJECTIVES  
- Enhance learners in their Christian philosophy of education, cognizant of the dignity of an individual.  
- Enrich the sense of responsibility, sensitivity for others, and inclusivity in the spirit of CICM mission of inculcating understanding and brotherhood to all, especially the poor and the non-Christian.  
- Provide the learners with the knowledge and skills that promote creativity, critical thinking, and scholarly research needed for national development.  
- Innovate mediums and resources to operate as a self-reliant unit and sustain long-term growth and development.  
- Cultivate in the students the appreciation of diversity, order and beauty, scientific outlook, and deep sense of national identity and cultural historicity.  
- Instill in students the love for and commitment to both intellectual and moral excellence to sustain their dedication to their profession.  
- Cultivate relevant knowledge and skills needed in the real world.  
- Mold missionary disciples who are socially aware and responsive to the needs of the family, church, and society.
