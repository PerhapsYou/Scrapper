===========================================================  
SEA OUTCOMES-BASED EDUCATION (OBE) FRAMEWORK  
===========================================================  

Relevance in education means addressing the needs of students and employees today,  
while equipping future graduates with a curriculum of global compatibility (CMO 37, S2012).  
SLU is cognizant of this global movement and has proactively implemented  
Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) in its undergraduate programs starting AY 2014–2015.

-----------------------------------------------------------  
OBE FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
The SLU SEA OBE Framework consists of three major sections:

1. **Working Groups**
2. **Constructive Alignment**
3. **Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI)**

These components form the pillars of SEA's modernized and structured approach to OBE.

-----------------------------------------------------------  
1. WORKING GROUPS  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
This section replaces the older "OBE Committees" section from the previous framework.  
It includes coordination and collaboration across the following levels:

- **Institutional Level:**
  • University Academic Council  
  • University Instructional Development Committee (UIDC)

- **School Level:**
  • Dean  
  • CQI Coordinator  
  • Department Heads

- **Program Level:**
  • Department Heads  
  • Faculty Members  

These groups work closely with program constituents to:
- Develop, implement, assess, evaluate, and recalibrate OBE components.

-----------------------------------------------------------  
2. CONSTRUCTIVE ALIGNMENT  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
Constructive alignment ensures that SEA’s OBE system:
- Is properly structured and  
- Complies with universally accepted educational standards.

**Key Terminology Update:**  
The term *Student Outcomes (SOs)* is now used instead of *Program Outcomes (POs)*  
to align with the Philippine Technological Council’s (PTC) official nomenclature.

-----------------------------------------------------------  
3. CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (CQI)  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
CQI remains integral in the updated OBE Framework, ensuring that the system:
- Responds to feedback and performance data  
- Enhances processes for instruction, curriculum, and assessment  
- Sustains a loop of reflection and improvement at all levels
