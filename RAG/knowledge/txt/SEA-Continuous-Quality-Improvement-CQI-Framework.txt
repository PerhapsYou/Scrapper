SEA CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT (CQI) FRAMEWORK  
===========================================================  

The Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) reflects the SEA's commitment to continually provide quality Catholic education  
through continuous enhancement of its services to meet the ever-changing needs of its constituents.  

The CQI occurs at all levels of the SLU-SEA Outcomes-Based Education (OBE) system. To strengthen the effectiveness of CQI initiatives,  
SEA has introduced key modifications to its CQI framework.

-----------------------------------------------------------  
REVISED CQI FRAMEWORK  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
The revised SEA CQI Framework (see Figure 2) is composed of **three core elements** that provide a structured approach to CQI implementation:

1. **CQI's Foundational Goal:**  
   - To provide **Quality Catholic Education** to all students.

2. **Collaborative Implementation Groups:**  
   - University Administration  
   - Working Groups  
   - Program Constituents  
   These entities work in unison to implement CQI activities across all levels.

3. **CQI Implementation Levels (via Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle):**  
   - **Institutional Level**  
   - **School Level**  
   - **Program Level**

-----------------------------------------------------------  
CQI IN THE OBE FRAMEWORK  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
The OBE framework integrates the CQI process by maintaining communication lines that connect:

- The **CQI block** to:
  - **Constructive Alignment**
  - **OBE Committees**
  - **Program Constituencies**

These communication loops ensure that feedback and data from the CQI process directly influence:

- Instructional alignment strategies  
- Decisions made by working groups  
- Stakeholder engagement and development  

Likewise, **lines from Program Constituencies back to the CQI cycles** emphasize the critical role stakeholders play in shaping and refining  
all aspects of SEA’s quality assurance and improvement processes.
