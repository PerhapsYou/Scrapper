Did you know that nine out of the last sixteen Presidents of the Philippines were lawyers?  
That’s not just a coincidence. The Philippines' Senate, House of Representatives, and top businesses are driven by the expertise of lawyers. From champions of justice to advocates for peace, lawyers play a crucial role in shaping society.
