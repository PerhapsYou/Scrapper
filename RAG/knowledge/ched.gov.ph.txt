Gender and Development

The CHED GAD Focal Committee conducted a GAD Webinar Series on 19-20 December 2022, via Zoom, that highlights on gender sensitivity, mental health awareness, gender-based sexual harassment, and CHED’s GAD mainstreaming policies and guidelines. As the Commission’s advocacy in fully implementing GAD in all higher education institutions in the country, it is imperative to orient its officials and employees on the basic GAD concepts and policies.

Following the approval of the CMO No. 3, Series of 2022 or the “Guidelines on Gender-Based Sexual Harassment in Higher Education Institutions” on February 2022, the CHED GAD Focal Committee conducted a series of orientations nationwide. The main objective of this rollout series is to orient and introduce all Philippine Higher Education Institutions (PHEIs) the rules and provisions of RA 11313 or the “Safe Spaces Act” and to familiarize themselves with the localized guidelines in the context of higher education, which is the CMO No. 3, Series of 2022.

The first leg of orientation was conducted in La Union, spearheaded by the CHED Regional Office I in La Union on 27 April 2022. The second leg of the rollout was in Baguio City, as led by CHED Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) on 29 April 2022.

The following rollout sessions were conducted through Island Groups (Luzon-Visayas-Mindanao), following the agreed resolution on the compliance of the GAD Focal Committee members’ respective schedules and logistical concerns.

The third session was for the Visayas Cluster, conducted in Bacolod City on 07 September 2022, as spearheaded by CHED Regional Office VI. Other regions, such as VII and VIII, were also present.

The fourth session of the rollout series was conducted in Davao City on 13 December 2022, as organized by CHED Regional Office XI. Other CHED Regional Offices such as 9, 10, 12, and CARAGA were also present.

The CHED GAD Focal Committee conducted an assembly of the CHED GAD Focal Persons on 17-18 November 2022 at La Union, as hosted by CHED Regional Office I. The objectives of this activity is to review the GAD accomplishment report of all CHED Regional Offices and to prepare the FY 2023 GAD Plan and Budget of the Commission. Dr. Helen Dayo, Member of the Technical Panel on Gender and Women Studies was invited as the resource speaker to help and guide the GAD Focal Persons in identifying the gender issues that are prevalent in the Commission and higher education institutions. An orientation was also given to all regional gad focal persons on the basic concepts of GAD and the technical aspects on the preparation of the GAD Plan and Budget

The Conference gathered higher education officials and members of the academe from the 10 ASEAN member-states to tackle the challenge of integrating gender equality in higher education and commit to a common plan of action plan in the region.

The event also intends to call attention to the remaining gaps in gender and development initiatives and build stronger partnerships for increased social protection for women and children alongside regional economic integration.

The last day of the Conference expanded to include more than 500 local participants, which will tie in with CHED’s annual hosting of the “Higher Education Summit on Gender Issues”.

Since 2010, CHED has been pushing for the agenda to mainstream gender and development in higher education. It has issued several landmark policy statements and documents, the most prominent of which is CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 01, series of 2015 or the “Establishing the Policies and Guidelines on Gender and Development in CHED and HEIs.”

The quality of education depends largely on the qualifications and competencies of the faculty. In view of the faculty’s vital role in influencing education outcomes, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) requires that teachers at higher education level must have at least masters degree in the fields in which they teach. The Faculty Development Program (FDP) is a critical factor towards building the strong foundation of an educational system to ensure quality education. In previous and current studies, faculty development has always surfaced as a priority concern. Our nation cannot compete with its neighboring countries that are now moving towards offering cutting-edge programs and technologies unless we invest in creating a pool of experts in our academic institutions. This critical mass will then be capable to train and equip students for significant and promising careers in the global market. More than 50% or 70,000 higher education institutions (HEIs) faculty need to upgrade their qualifications and competencies in order to improve the quality of teaching in our HEIs.

The vast majority of students in higher education are being taught by faculty who possess no more than the level of qualification for which they are studying. Low teacher qualification inevitably leads to low standards of learning achievement among students. CHED Memorandum Order (CMO) No. 40, s. 2008 which requires all higher education institutions (HEIs) faculty to have at least masters degree shall be fully implemented by AY 2011-2012. Hence, there is need to encourage and provide assistance to HEIs to enable them to meet this CMO requirement.

About the Commission

About the Commission

The Commission on Higher Education (CHED)  was created on May 18, 1994 through the passage of Republic Act No. 7722, or the Higher Education Act of 1994. CHED, an attached agency to the Office of the President for administrative purposes, is headed by a chairperson and four commissioners, each having a term of office of four years. The Commission En Banc  acts as a collegial body in formulating plans, policies and strategies relating to higher education and the operation of CHED.

The creation of CHED was part of a broad agenda of reforms on the country’s education system outlined by the Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM) in 1992. Part of the reforms was the trifocalization of the education sector into three governing bodies: the CHED for tertiary and graduate education, the Department of Education (DepEd) for basic education and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) for technical-vocational and middle-level education.

In 1997, Republic Act (RA) No. 8292, otherwise known as the “Higher Education Modernization Act of 1997” was passed to establish a complete, adequate and integrated system of higher education. The said law also modified and made uniform the composition of the Governing Boards of chartered state universities and colleges (SUCs) nationwide in order to:(a) achieve a more coordinated and integrated system of higher education;(b) render them more effective in the formulation and implementation of policies on higher education;(c) provide for more relevant direction in their governance; and (d) ensure the enjoyment of academic freedom as guaranteed by the Constitution.

Philippine higher education system that is equitable and producing locally responsive, innovative, and globally competitive graduates and lifelong learners.

To promote equitable access and ensure quality and relevance of higher education institutions and their programs.

Given the national government’s commitment to transformational leadership that puts education as the central strategy for investing in the Filipino people, reducing poverty, and building national competitiveness and pursuant to Republic Act 7722, CHED shall:

A. Promote relevant and quality higher education (i.e. higher education institutions and programs are at par with international standards and graduates and professionals are highly competent and recognized in the international arena);

B. Ensure that quality higher education is accessible to all who seek it particularly those who may not be able to afford it;

C. Guarantee and protect academic freedom for continuing intellectual growth, advancement of learning and research, development of responsible and effective leadership, education of high level professionals, and enrichment of historical and cultural heritages; and

D. Commit to moral ascendancy that eradicates corrupt practices, institutionalizes transparency and accountability and encourages participatory governance in the Commission and the sub-sector.

We, at the Commission on Higher Education (CHED), shall lead the  Philippine higher education sector to:

Cultivate an equitable and sustainable higher education landscape that produces locally responsive, innovative, globally competitive graduates, and life long learners;

Harmonize mandates to promote inclusive access to higher education, ensure sustainable quality assurance of programs, and assert relevance of institutions;

Exemplify resilience and humility in service, integrity, excellence, and development-driven mindset; and,

Demonstrate commitment to fulfill statutory and regulatory requirements to maintain and achieve continual improvement in our Quality Management System to achieve our vision.

As provided for under Section 8 of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 7722, the Commission on Higher Education shall have the following powers and functions:

The CHED LOGO is a representation of how Philippine Higher Education evolved.

The pyramid represents the ideal three-level, manpower structure of the country, comprising of basic level skills, middle or semi-skilled workers, and high or professional levels of human resource located at the apex of the pyramid and the primary concern of higher education.

The  human silhouette inside the pyramid represents human resources development of every Filipino to become productive citizens of the country.

The rising sun symbolizes the dawning of a new era in higher education with the creation of CHED. With the emergence of CHED, higher education was given the much needed attention and appropriate reforms implemented which jump started the development of higher education as the prime mover in nation-building.

The color triad:  red ,  yellow and blue correspond to the colors of the Philippine flags as CHED was created to be the main advocate and pillar of nation building.

The year 1994 indicates the year when CHED was created by law. On May 18, 1994, CHED was established through Republic Act No. 7722, otherwise known as the “Higher Education Act 1994” The CHED is an Attached.

CHED, PRC create new LET specialization components

CHED, PRC create new LET specialization components

To address issues concerning teacher quality, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and Philippine Regulation Commission (PRC) partnered to deliver new specialization components in the licensure examination for teachers (LET).

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. stood witness in the signing of the Joint Memorandum Circular (JMC) between the CHED Secretary Popoy De Vera and PRC Chairperson Charito A. Zamora at the Malacañan Palace today.

The key feature of the agreement is the alignment of the LET for Early Childhood Education, Special Needs Education, Technical-Vocational Teacher Education, Physical Education, and Culture and Arts Education with the CHED programs, standards, and guidelines (PSGs).

This effectively enables graduates of such specializations to take a more suitable test that determines their readiness to teach. Ultimately, it is expected to contribute to resolving the teacher-subject mismatch in basic education schools.

“This landmark reform embodies our commitment to ensure that every Filipino teacher is equipped with the skills and tools needed to teach with depth, clarity, and purpose. It is a vital step towards raising the quality of education for the present, and most importantly for the future,” President Marcos said.

“CHED fully supports the formulation of specialized licensure examinations for teachers and commits to actively collaborate with the PRC to ensure the effective delivery and implementation of this landmark joint agreement,” De Vera said.

“This is set to transform the teacher licensure process by introducing distinct examinations tailored to each teacher education program specialization, in accordance with the 2017 CHED PSGs. It marks a significant milestone in our collective effort to deploy highly qualified, licensed teachers to schools across the country,” he added.

“Aligning the board licensure examinations for professional teachers is a critical measure to guarantee the quality of education in the classroom,” Zamora said.

Last week, CHED awarded one hundred twenty (120) teacher education institutions for their competence in producing educators through their adherence to accredited program standards, continuous improvement in teaching methodologies, and stellar performance in the Board of Licensure Examination for Professional Teachers (BLEPT).

These top TEIs are set to assist other Philippine higher education institutions to improve their quality assurance mechanisms to ensure they meet and exceed national standards for teacher education.

Currently, there one thousand five hundred thirty-six (1,536) Philippine HEIs offering teacher education programs.

Free higher education in LUCs continues with PBBM-approved CHED fund augmentation

Free higher education in LUCs continues with PBBM-approved CHED fund augmentation

President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. approved to augment the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) fund to support the continuous delivery of Free Higher Education to CHED-recognized local colleges and universities (LUCs).

The President has authorized the use of P577,122,033.08 to address a deficiency in the funding for Free Higher Education reimbursements for CHED-recognized LUCs.

The augmentation was made following the recommendation of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) dated March 13, 2025, and the representations made by CHED.

“Of all state expenditures, education delivers the best dividends. This administration remains committed to the continuing provision of free tertiary education in public universities and colleges for qualified students as provided under the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act,” President Marcos Jr. said during the first National Higher Education Summit.

“We thank the President for approving our request to augment the funding for the Free Higher Education program under the UAQTEA, as part of the continuing appropriations of the Fiscal Year 2024 General Appropriations Act or the RA 11975. We would like to also thank DBM Secretary Amenah Pangandaman for endorsing the Commission’s request for fund augmentation to the President. This is a testament that the national government considers higher education as a priority and is committed to ensure the continuous delivery of free tertiary education,” CHED Secretary Popoy De Vera said.

“Consistent with this administration’s assurance to continue the Free Higher Education program, CHED, through the UniFAST, remains on track in delivering its commitment to accessible and equitable higher education for all Filipinos,” he added.

This funding realignment falls under the provisions of Republic Act 10931 or the UAQTEA, which mandates free tuition and other school fees for Filipino students enrolled at CHED-recognized LUCs being implemented by CHED through the UniFAST Secretariat.

The augmentation will cover tuition and thirteen (13) other school fees of tertiary level students included in more than three hundred fifty thousand (350,000) students enrolled in LUCs.

ETEEAP

Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program

Legal Bases: Republic Act No. 12124, Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP)

The Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) is an educational assessment scheme that recognizes knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values (KSAVs) and prior learning obtained by individuals from non-formal and informal education experiences. By establishing equivalency competence standards and a comprehensive assessment system employing written test, interview, skills demonstration and other creative assessment methodologies, deputized higher education institutions may administer competency-based evaluation. The deputized HEI may convene a Panel of Assessors to determine the candidate’s KSAVs relevant to a particular discipline, and awards appropriate equivalency credit or academic degree to the successful candidate.

The mandate to implement the Program is embodied in Executive Order 330 issued by then President Fidel V. Ramos on May 10, 1996 as an offshoot of the recommendation of the First Philippine Employment Summit held in September 1995.

CHED backs strategic media-education partnership between MSU and PTV4

CHED backs strategic media-education partnership between MSU and PTV4

The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) facilitated the development of a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Mindanao State University (MSU) and the People’s Television Network, Inc. (PTV4), aimed at strengthening MSU’s capacity for information documentation and dissemination.

The initiative was set in motion following a recent meeting between CHED Secretary and MSU Board of Regents (BOR) Chairman Popoy De Vera, PTV Chairman Oscar Orbos, and members of the MSU BOR, where key areas of collaboration were identified.

“CHED is committed to supporting this meaningful partnership between MSU and PTV. It is a vital step toward empowering our universities, especially in the regions, to tell their own stories—stories of hope, innovation, and transformation. Mindanao deserves a stronger voice in the national conversation, and MSU is well-positioned to lead that,” De Vera said.

“One of our goals in the Commission is to ensure that we make higher education more visible, more relevant, and more connected to the Filipino people,” he added.

“A state university engaged in communicating directly with the people in joint venture and coordination with a state broadcasting network is a very strong initiative to boost enlightenment, information dissemination, and development particularly in the Mindanao area. The partnership aligns with our vision to serve as a platform for government initiatives and regional voices,” Orbos said.

PTV, as the flagship government television network, will provide technical expertise and media platforms to help MSU produce and disseminate compelling stories about the progress, peace initiatives, and educational achievements in Mindanao.

MSU will gain access to capacity-building programs, technical training, and broadcast opportunities from PTV4.

Moreover, it will not only capacitate MSU to share impact stories and academic achievements but will also open up new feedback channels for educational stakeholders, parents, alumni, and local communities to engage with the university.

“By leveraging PTV4’s nationwide reach and public service orientation, there will be a two-way communication platform which will foster transparency, responsiveness, and community involvement in higher education,” De Vera said.

The partnership also presents a tremendous opportunity to enhance MSU’s Mass Communication Program as it will allow students to access cutting-edge media production tools, real-world internship opportunities, and guidance from media experts in PTV4.

“This collaboration is part of CHED’s broader mission to ensure that HEIs are equipped to tell the stories that matter and showcase their contributions to national development. CHED is committed to assist other HEIs in the country to explore similar opportunities,” De Vera said.

CHED, PTV4, and MSU are working closely and actively to finalize the MOU and formalize the partnership.

PTV is the flagship public television network owned by the Philippine government under the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) providing nationwide television and other communications services.

More medical educators to receive world-class training on simulation-based medical education with CHED, University of Adelaide partnership

More medical educators to receive world-class training on simulation-based medical education with CHED, University of Adelaide partnership

The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and University of Adelaide strengthened partnership to provide more faculty members of medical schools in the Philippines with world-class and technologically advanced training on simulation-based medical education.

Simulation-based medical education (SBME), widely practiced at leading medical schools around the world, uses realistic scenarios, tools, and technologies – such as manikins, virtual reality, and standardized patients – to replicate clinical environments and allow healthcare learners to practice and refine their skills in a safe, controlled setting.

In the second leg of the CHED transnational education mission, CHED Secretary Popoy De Vera met with the officials of the University of Adelaide to boost and expand the training program in SBME which will be delivered in collaboration with the University of the Philippine (UP) Manila.

The Philippine delegation also toured the University of Adelaide’s Adelaide Health Simulation (AHS) to explore its cutting-edge simulation technologies and gain insights on how to effectively and efficiently deliver the health simulation training to Filipino medical educators.

The University of Adelaide AHS is recognized as a world-class and most technologically advanced healthcare simulation institution in Australasia.

“This training program on simulation-based medical education is in line with the Doktor Para Sa Bayan Law instructing the Commission to increase access to medical education by helping establish at least one public medical school in every region in the country. But the goal is to not only make medical education accessible but also globally-competitive. This partnership is part of CHED’s long-term vision to create a future where every Filipino medical student, regardless of region, has access to the best education possible,” De Vera said.

“President Bongbong Marcos has given a clear directive to the Commission to facilitate opportunities for the faculty members of our HEIs to upskill and reskill to ensure that Filipino students are provided with quality education and our medical schools continue to produce world-class doctors who can practice the profession all over the world or serve our underserved communities,” De Vera said.

“We thank CHED for trusting UP Manila to partner with the University of Adelaide in the training of faculty of new Colleges of Medicine of our SUCs. Through technology-driven simulation-based education students will be able to practice how it is to be doctors, even before they reach the clinics. They will be able to experience clinical situations, and procedures on hi-fidelity mannequins and task trainers to ensure that they are ready to meet their patients ” UP Manila Chancellor Michael Tee said.

In 2020, CHED has signed an agreement with University of Adelaide to cooperate on capacity building of educators from Philippine HEIs. The agreement facilitated the training of thirty (30) faculty members from top medical schools in the country – University of the Philippines (UP) Manila , West Visayas State University (WVSU), and Mindanao State University-General Santos (MSU-GenSan) – on simulation-based medical education at University of Adelaide’s Adelaide Health Simulation (AHS) in 2022.

Moreover, one hundred seven (107) faculty members received a faculty development workshop from the University of Adelaide delivered online in 2023. Fifty-two (52) medical educators were trained at UP Manila by experts from University of Adelaide in 2024.

Participants received comprehensive training on simulation-based education, including business modeling, governance structures, equipment operation, curriculum integration, and the essential training required to establish and sustain purpose-built simulation centers.

Now, CHED is expanding this cutting-edge training program, in partnership with UP Manila, to upskill another set of faculty members from four or five medical schools in the country who have existing simulation-based medical education equipment.

“Our plan is to add four or five medical schools, public or private, who are also using the simulation-based medical equipment to create a bigger network. Two of the schools identified joined the Australia education mission – the University of Northern Philippines, and Don Mariano Marcos State University,” De Vera said.

Notably, CHED has been providing public medical schools in the country grants to procure state-of-the-art, high-fidelity mannequins and task-trainers to elevate the quality of medical education and training in the country.

CHED, key government agencies lead major push for stronger Philippines-Australia transnational education collaboration

CHED, key government agencies lead major push for stronger Philippines-Australia transnational education collaboration

The Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Philippine Board of Investments, Clark Development Corporation and university presidents pushed for transnational education with Australian universities in the higher education mission in Sydney and Adelaide, Australia.

The Transnational Education (TNE) Opportunity Forum, organized by the Education Centre of Australia (ECA), provided a platform for key Philippine and Australian universities to explore potential collaborations and mutually beneficial partnerships that will enhance academic exchanges, research cooperation, and student mobility.

In his talk at the TNE Opportunity Forum, CHED Secretary Popoy De Vera underscored the growing higher education landscape in the Philippines offering significant opportunities for Australian universities to expand their footprint in Asia and identified the areas of interest and strength of the Philippines.

“Based on UNESCO statistics, the Philippines is second to Singapore in terms of tertiary education participation rate. We are actually performing better than most ASEAN countries in terms of the graduate rate from the first degree. This means that we have a young population who are upwardly mobile, proficient in English, and looking for educational opportunities in many areas and in various modes,” De Vera said.

“President Bongbong Marcos has instructed the Commission to facilitate the internationalization of Philippine HEIs and focus on our core strengths or degree programs that produce world class professionals who are recognized all over the world. This includes medicine and allied health, S&T, aviation, animation, game development, maritime, IT, and tourism management,” he added.

“It was an opportunity for Clark Development Corp to present their Town and Gown program for the development of the manpower needs of the investors and locators in the Free port Zone and in the Special Economic Zone. The Transnational Higher Education Program will complete the human development program for the industries,” CDC President and CEO Atty. Agnes VST Devanadera said.

“This is an opportunity for BOI to present the Philippines as an ideal location for investments and partnerships in the education sector. The country’s population and strategic location as well as the Filipinos’ English proficiency and relatively lower cost of living make the Philippines an attractive market for foreign HEIs,” BOI Executive Director Corieh Dichosa said.

The education mission in Australia also included presidents and heads of five Philippine HEIs, with strong academic programs in the priority areas, including Chancellor Michael L. Tee of University of the Philippines Manila (UP Manila), President Maria Teresita P. Medado of Asia Pacific College (APC), President Renato Carlos H. Ermita Jr. of National University (NU), President Erwin Cadorna of University of Northern Philippines (UNP), and President Jaime Manuel of Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University (DMMMSU).

Through the ECA, TNE Opportunity Forum has also brought together leading Australian universities including Charles Sturt University, University of the Sunshine Coast, University of Technology Sydney, University of Canberra, Victoria University, University of New South Wales, Australian Catholic University, and University of Western Sydney to engage in TNE discussion and explore education partnerships with Philippine HEIs.

The education mission in Australia is an important step in the implementation of Republic Act No. 11448, also known as the Transnational Higher Education Act, that aims to provide Filipino students access to international education and ensure global competitiveness of Philippine higher education.

“This is a milestone in advancing the Philippines’ role in the global education sector, strengthening ties with Australia, and paving the way for future collaborations in higher education that will help both nations meet the evolving demands of the global workforce,” De Vera said.
