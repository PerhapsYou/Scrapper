# NaviBot

This project will hold the chatbot to be adopted by Saint Louis University for its portal.

In creating this bot two different architectures will be adopted catering to two different functions:

First, the RASA architecture was adopted. This architecture focused on the rule-based and intent-based coversations to be held when conversing with the bot. In here the RASA Free Developer Edition was adopted. As per their website, one bot can be used per company, with up to 1000 external conversations/month or 100 internal converations/month.
