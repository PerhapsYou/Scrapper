Rasa is an open-source framework for building conversational AI applications. It includes tools for natural language understanding (NLU) and dialogue management.

Rasa uses intents and entities to interpret user input. Intents describe what the user wants to do, and entities extract key information from the input.

Rasa provides a fallback mechanism, which is triggered when the model has low confidence in the predicted intent. This allows the chatbot to gracefully handle uncertain queries.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines a retriever and a generator. The retriever fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base, and the generator (usually a language model) uses them to craft a response.

FAISS is a library for efficient similarity search on dense vectors. In RAG, it is used to retrieve the most relevant chunks of knowledge based on a query vector.

HuggingFace Embeddings, such as 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2', are used to convert text into dense vectors for semantic search. These embeddings capture the meaning of sentences and enable similarity comparisons.

RAG pipelines often preprocess documents by splitting them into smaller chunks, typically with some overlap. This improves retrieval granularity and helps avoid losing context.

A typical chatbot pipeline might use Rasa for intent classification and fall back to a RAG pipeline when the intent is unknown or a more detailed answer is needed.
