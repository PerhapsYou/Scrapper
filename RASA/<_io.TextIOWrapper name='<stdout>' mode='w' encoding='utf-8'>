[94mIn RAG pipelines, FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), a library for efficient similarity search on dense vectors, is used to retrieve the most relevant chunks of knowledge based on a query vector. HuggingFace Embeddings, such as 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2', are employed to convert text into dense vectors for semantic search, capturing the meaning of sentences and enabling similarity comparisons.[0m
[94m3. RAG pipeline: This part of the pipeline consists of a retriever (FAISS) and a generator (usually a language model). The retriever fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base, and the generator uses these documents to craft a response. In the context of 'math', the knowledge base could include various math formulas, theorems, and explanations.[0m
